    "Dream": "“Scavengers” The most meaningful picture from my dream is that everything was burnt. It was like a post after the fire burning of the world. Yet even though there was cooled lava stone kind of shell overtop everything that was alive, there were still some people left. So some people had survived. And some people had scavenged stuff from the rubble or had hammered the crust with something and broken off a piece of some piece of junk - like an item you’d normally buy in a store, that kind of junk - and had scrabbled a living from this. The people that had done that were emaciated and skinny like skeletons with vacant eyes. Their whole focus was on what they had scavenged and made into a business to sell. They weren’t chasing me and I wasn’t running from them. Because I was uninterested in their scavenged things, it was like they didn’t even notice I was there. So I was able to be invisible. At one point in the dream, one of them looked at me and I still remember that hollow kind of hungry gaze and it pierced me for a second, and then I think because I didn’t return it, I didn’t need it - I didn’t need anything it had, its hunger just retracted and then it was as though I was insignificant and it left me alone. They were quite frightening to look at, so was what they had - it was like things you get from the dump, but there were people that were buying it and it was so awful.",

There’s a few other people that have survived it. The last one was really hot and dry. To be honest, I was in the dream, I was dreaming it and it was so hot and dry that I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I woke myself up and out of the dream.",

    "Dream": "“The Attacks” My dream last night was a nightmare. It starts in the town where I grew up. I’m in front of the house that I lived in when I was growing up. I’m sitting on the grass in the front lawn and I see a person but it’s not clearly identified features. I’m just somehow in my dream saying it’s a man. The man is running and shouting angrily. I feel threatened so I start to back up. The person runs into my neighbor’s house on the right. I can’t go in my own house because I'm not safe there so I sneak around the side of my house and am hiding in the backyard. I hear screaming and yelling and commotion. The man comes out of my neighbor’s house and starts coming back up towards my house and goes in - nothing happens because no one’s in there - and comes out. I realize that he is sneaking or stalking around the perimeter of my own house. So I avoid him but he’s not far behind and I don’t know where to go that’s safe. I notice that my other neighbor’s side door is open a little bit and I’m feeling kind of bad about going into the house without knocking, but if I don’t run in and close the door and lock it, then that thing will get me. So I run in, close the door and lock it and the lady that owns the house looks at me and says, “Oh! What are you doing in here?” I say, “Quick! Lock the front door! There’s an angry person!” (but I don’t call it that in the dream. I’ve given it a name and the name escapes me). I warn her, so she does and we listen and it’s yelling angrily and pounding at the door and trying to get in, but it doesn’t. But while it’s trying, I tell her that it’s been chasing me for ages and I’m really sorry for invading your privacy, but I needed to come in here or it would kill me. She says that’s okay, it’s alright. She calmly looks at me and says, “Freya, what have you been doing? I never see you anymore.” So she’s talking to me and she’s kind of oblivious that this thing is out there. And then our small talk finishes. It’s quiet. It’s been quiet. I hov...",

    "Dream": "“The Sandbox'' In this odd mix of imagery and people, I find myself in a large two-story house with various people that I know from my extended family and where I currently work. The dream begins with C.R. from work and she’s been given the responsibility of taking care of two babies - one is about 10 months, almost ready to walk but not ready walking independently, and one can’t be anymore than 9 months older, not even two and he’s male. Later on in the dream when I ask what the children’s names are, someone tells me that the younger one is named Stacey and the older one is Alexander. So she’s taking care of them and I see her bring the babies out of a room and wonder if maybe they’ve just been bathed because they’re naked. She lays the younger one down on the rug beside the railing. The older one is standing. She tells them to stay there while she goes into a different room and gets diapers. I’m coming out of another room and I see them there and think, “Why is she laying them there? It’s really close to the stairs.” I’m thinking that the younger one can roll and fall down the stairs. I start to move towards that child and at the same time, she rolls and goes all the way down the stairs face first! I’m just horrified and thinking, “Oh my god!” She lands at the bottom and C.R. comes out of the room carrying the diapers, picks her up, and she’s okay! She carries her back upstairs and says, “Here can you hold her?” So, I do. I’m standing there with a naked baby on my hip. I’m looking at her and thinking, “Don’t you pee on me!” And that’s when I ask, “Whose children are these and what are their names?” Someone comes up to me and says the younger one is Stacey, the older one is Alexander. They belong to someone, but the name is muffled so I can’t understand what it is. That person isn’t there right now. Now the scenery that evolves around me is a kitchen. I’m standing there and there's people at the table. I see my stepmom’s brother and sister-in-law who’ve been very k...",

    "Dream": "“The Concert” The setting of this dream is the house I used to live in in Toronto. It starts and I’m in the kitchen with many other people. I had three roommates in this house, sometimes 4. It was close to UFT. Most of us were students, though some were not. I don’t know everybody in the kitchen this particular day, though I do know some of them. Everything in this dream is long and slow motion and drawn out and stretched in terms of the background. It’s not that people are moving in slow motion, but the minutes between things are elongated and stretched. I woke up feeling really heavy and groggy. In the kitchen, someone is making toast and the toaster is way across the kitchen. While the toast is in the toaster and I’m waiting for my turn, there’s at least 7 people that come in and out of the kitchen and have conversations, then leave the kitchen again, and the toast is still in the toaster. It’s not burnt, though. I can see the elements are still on, but it’s taking ages to toast yet the relationships among people are moving at a normal speed. I don’t question this in the dream - it’s not until I wake up that I notice everything in the dream is taking longer. In the kitchen, I’m oblivious of this distortion of time. I do, however, have these conversations with people. When I realize I’m not going to have toast that day, I leave the kitchen and go upstairs to my room. I go through the drawers in my room, looking to see what's there because a concert is happening tonight and Omar is meeting me at my house along with a couple of other friends. I start to prepare and I’m deciding what to wear. In one of the drawers, I find a bunch of checks. I look at it and wonder where these came from. When I start to look through it, I realize these are checks that a whole bunch of people have given me. They are of various amounts for an endeavor I’m supposed to be taking. They have invested in me. I realize I haven’t put them in the bank and they aren’t very safe where they are ro...",

    "Dream": "This dream starts in a house where I am getting ready to go on a journey. The journey begins at a certain time for me. But as I’m starting to pack, I realize my daughter is also coming with me. There’s other people in the house besides my daughter. They seem to be part of the background, like white noise, although occasionally one will come up and make some kind of remark or offer some bit of direction or advice. I’m packing bags. There’s a reason, although I don’t know what, that my daughter has to leave 10 minutes before I do and I’m going to meet her there. I pack both of our bags separately and I make two different lunches - one for her, one for me. As I go to leave out the apartment door, one of the people that lives there, comes up. Although she does not look like my step-mother, she carries the energy of her and the dynamic between us is the same. She questions me and says, “Are you sure you should be doing that?” I tell her, “It’s fine, I have to do this anyway.” Then I close the door. Although I do not see how I get to the train station, we suddenly shift from my apartment to the train station. I am standing there to purchase her train ticket and the conductor or ticket seller says to me: “How old is that child?” I look down in puzzlement and see that she’s only five. I think, “How did that happen? My daughter is much older than that.” I see her as older but having a 5-year old body. I think, “Well, I can’t send a 5-year-old by themselves on this 3-hour train ride to a different country. It’s not safe.” So, I tell him I’ve changed my mind. Then I’m uncertain what to do. Now I’m in a dilemma. I sit outside the train station for a moment with her. I start talking to her and describing the country we’re about to go to. I tell her that it’s Rome and describe the kind of life we would have there. She’s enjoying the story. But now I have to figure out how I’m going to get us there at the same time. In that moment, the dream shifts. I'm not at the train station an...",

    "Dream": "“COVID Anxiety Dream” The setting is my elementary school. People are getting shelter in that school, like quarantine. I am one of those people. The whole dream is inked and soaked with sinister dirty energy. It’s just horrible. There’s the feeling that something or someone is going to find us and we’re hiding. Then for some reason, people start going outside. We feel we have to. There’s not a choice. So we start walking single-file and there’s quite a few minutes between each person as they exit the building. So first I’m standing outside by myself and it’s dark, it’s nighttime. Then I can still see the lights on in the school because I’m standing in the schoolyard. Then a few minutes later, someone else comes out of the building and a few minutes later someone else comes out. There are about five people. Then from around the other side of the building come two people. One of them is viciously stabbing the other person. There’s blood everywhere. While the attacker is occupied with the stabbing, the people that I’m standing there with are like, “Where are we going to go? We have to go somewhere where we’re not in danger from this person.” Then we walk around to the other side of the building and there’s a tuck shop on the lawn. We’re hiding around one side of the tuck shop which is closed. Then the attacker that was stabbing is covered with blood and is walking through the crowd because more people have come to gather around the tuck shop. They’re standing social distance apart. No one is standing close together. No one is huddled. So it’s not even really a group. There are about twelve people and we know that he might stab each one of us, but he’s not coming close enough. He’s just wielding the knife around and walking drunkenly.",

    "Dream": "“Wooden Ship” In this dream I'm on a really big, long ship made entirely of wood. It’s between 40 and 60 feet long. It’s shaped like an arc or one of the older viking style ships. The ship belongs to my friend Randy from high school. He is captioning it and he’s invited me to go out on the ship for a day. The wood is really old - it’s dry and cracked from the sun, there's no luster in it or polish on the outside. In order to make it sea-worthy, there's this thick almost hemp-like woven netting about 5 inches thick and tight weave that cascades down from the gunnels to the hull. It’s not on the bottom of the hull, it just goes way past the draft all the way down to the bottom. It’s got debris filtered from the water as it’s gone through. So there's no spaces between the weaves, between the organic debris and the tightness of it. There’s a ladder to climb up the side and it swings a bit with your body weight as you climb. So I climb up, wrap my leg over the top, hop down and I’m standing on the deck. Randy follows me and takes the wheel. We start moving. I can feel the sway of the ship on top of the water and am starting to enjoy the splashes that come up over the sides. The channel where we are is relatively busy. We haven’t gone all the way out into the body of water. We’re still going through the channel. I’m standing on the bow, leaning over, and I see rock - like a shelf of rock underneath the surface of the water. So I shout back to him: “Randy, it’s too shallow here, we’ll never make it through! We’re going to run aground!” He says, “No, no, we’ll be fine. I’ve done this before.” He’s maneuvering the ship and I’m positive it’s going to scrape because it looks like the rock shelf is only about 12 inches under the water and you’re going to scrape your keel. You’re going to get stuck there. The ship is still going over it. We maneuver over quite a few of these and come out into the open water where you don’t need to man the ship so closely. So I walk from the bow ...",

There were no emotions as I was looking out at all different kinds of settings and landscapes, like I was passing through but didn’t belong. There were no people in it. It was all nighttime and dark and quiet. At some point, just before I woke up, that’s when I realized I was cataloging things through my eye. I started to realize there was a human part of me that realized I was cyborg. That’s when the creepy feeling started coming in about not feeling anything. Then I woke up. I couldn’t shake the creepy feeling of not having emotions. It just carried through like wiry air that was empty of something.",

    "Dream": "“Dancing on the Edge” In this dream, it’s in a house that I don’t recognize - it’s not mine, I’ve never been in it. The set up is we’re all on the top floor - I don’t even know what’s in the basement. The top floor of the house as you come up the stairs at one end from the main floor is a sitting room. As you walk from that door, you go through the kitchen and you keep walking through the kitchen, you come to an eating area - dining room. Then straight ahead of the eating room are a few bedrooms. The doors are closed; we don’t see them in the dream. Off to the left is an upper floor sun room that has chairs in it and a lot of windows. The whole upstairs feels worn - the floors dip in the middle and there’s the old kind of linoleum tile that curls up at the edges of each square. The windows have a film of dust and age. The paint has dulled. The paint is chipped on the frames around the doors and you can see the wood through it. Dust has stuck to the cupboards in the kitchen and they look a little greasy. The furniture is all old and of poor quality. It’s full of people. The dream begins where I’m gathered with some people around a table in the eating area. We’ve divided up a number of tasks we have to complete. One of those persons is my yoga teacher from my teacher training. He seems to be in charge of it and is assigning tasks. Everyone is listening to him. So we’re divided up into groups of two or three people and we go down. I don’t see the stairs as we go down, but I’m just suddenly outside of the house on the sidewalk and in the street. In the dream, there’s no time devoted to the journey of going in and out of each store to pick up what we’re supposed to. I just know that we’ve done it. We’re back in the meeting place with our bags. They’re not a lot of bags. They also show signs of poor quality and age. We each only have two or three items in our bag. As we group up, it’s like a hydropole - a wooden post like that - and that’s where we’re supposed to meet. We...",

    "Dream": "“The Monster Outside the Window” In this dream, I’m sleeping in a room on the upper floor of a house. I don’t recognize the house. It has two windows that are gabled. In front of one of the windows, entering in the room, is a closet - it is not a very big one. It has two bars on either side of it with clothes hanging on. It’s probably about 7 feet from the internal door of the closet to the window. I can see the window outside of the closet. It’s almost like the closet, if you look right at it is a closet with solid walls; but when I’m in bed, I can see what’s outside of the window - both of them at the same time. So it’s almost like the walls have color and appear to be dense, yet I can see through them. The dream starts with me going to bed and I wake up in the middle of the night. I can see there’s something terrible - something I’m afraid of - outside of the window. I’m afraid to move in my bed. I don’t go back to sleep and I stay there until the morning. The day just passes in a blur. Then I go back to bed and again, I’m trying to go to sleep, but I’m awake because I know that thing is going to come back and it’s going to be outside my window again. In fact, I start to realize that it’s always outside of the window. Then, as I’m lying in bed awake, I start to get a little bit curious about what exactly it is outside of the window. So I get out of my bed and I open the door and I peek into the closet. Nothing happens yet. So I open the door a little wider and I go a little bit more into the closet. Now I’m just standing in the closet. I can feel its presence through the window pane. I’m just standing there. As I’m standing there, my ex-husband comes into the room. He starts making noise and stuff. I say, “What are you doing in here? Please stop.” He ignores me and comes into the closet. He says, “I have to get a shirt.” I tell him to stop, “Stop doing that, you’re going to disturb it.” But he doesn’t. Then the thing starts to come closer to the window. Then I re...",

    "Dream": "“The Lecture Hall” The dream begins with me leaving the house I live in. I’m going to walk to a lecture. I have a backpack on. I’m wearing a raincoat. It’s quite a hike, but that’s not unusual for me. I like to walk. The walk takes about an hour. It’s just straight up a street, block after block, tree lined and very pretty. It’s a small town. It’s like walking up Cathedral Avenue in BC with huge trees that form an umbrella - they reach toward each other overtop. So I don’t even feel the rain. It’s raining out, but I’m not feeling it on my body or my face. I’m not getting wet. I arrive at the place where the lecture is and it’s a house. I realize that it’s the house of my professor, M.M. So, I walk up to the side and knock on the door and she answers it. The door opens out into her kitchen. She’s happy to see me, though we don’t hug. We stand about 6 feet apart, respecting social distancing. There's several other people in the kitchen and they're all in some kind of process of removing outer clothing and hanging it up on hooks. Then we go down the hall from the kitchen, into an enormous university style lecture hall where there’s theatre seats and a stage. At this point, M.M. disappears and I realize that the lecture is not on the psychology topic I thought it was on, but it’s two men who are standing there and they’re kind of counting the number of people that they have. I can overhear their conversation. They’re saying that they thought there’d be more than this. But, “this is a good turnout anyway and let’s hope we can sell it.” I think, “Oh, man, I’m not here to buy anything,” and I’m disappointed. So the two men walk down the aisle towards the stage. They don’t even mount the stage yet, when people start leaving. Then the one man stands to the side and the other one gets up and stands behind the podium and he begins to talk but doesn’t say anything. More and more people are leaving until there’s only 3 or 4 people left. Then he ceases the talk and says, “Well I ...",

    "Dream": "“The Arms Dealer” This dream setting is a busy small town, disproportionately overrun with criminals and crime rings for the size of its population. My consciousness has filtered down and is inhabiting a man who is involved in explosives. So my consciousness is inside this man who is in a store. It appears to be a bookstore that sells other sundry items. But his contact is the employee who works in the store. So he’s not there to buy books. I realize I’m not in my own body because I see my arm and it’s a man arm with a man hand. I look at my chest and am wearing a leather jacket that’s not mine. So I hand the store employee a piece of paper and it has three ingredients on it that my own consciousness suddenly recognizes as a recipe for gunpowder. Phosphorus. I can’t see the other two names, but that’s what I think. Then, he talks to the man behind the counter and sets a meetup time where they are also supposed to put their gunpowder in a warehouse that’s going to be picked up by someone else that night. That’s the point I realize they’ve both been hired by someone else to do this. Then the man exits teh bookstore door. He goes out. He turns right, goes one storefront down the street, and the building says, Scotts Decorating, but it has round cafe tables out in front. He sits down with his other two buddies and shares what he’s done at the bookstore and the meetup time tonight, and says, “Okay, does everybody have it clear what their roles are?” They nod and agree. Then I notice I have this dry cough. One of them says, “Eh, shouldn’t you bow out of this because of your cough? Aren’t we not supposed to jostle this material or there’s the danger of it exploding?” Man consciousness me says, “No, it’s okay. It’ll be fine.” The part of my own consciousness that’s trapped in there says, “You have to be kidding! Why are you in denial of this? You can’t have any cough. It’s not supposed to be jostled once.” I feel frustrated inside this guy’s consciousness. Then, he has a fe...",

    "Dream": "“The Greenhouse” This dream begins in the house I grew up in for a little while. I’m standing in the driveway and I see my ex-husband drive up. He’s in a van and he comes out of the van. He’s loading things from the back of the van onto the driveway. I see his dead son, whom I never met in real life, get out of the van with him and sit on the driveway. Then my ex is busy with something at the other end of the driveway. Now there’s a hill where the back up the van is, going up to where my ex is busy. His dead son is trying to climb up the hill to get to him, but he can’t because he can’t walk. He was crippled in real life. So I go over to help him. I put my arm around his waist and my other hand is digging at the earth and I’m dragging him up with me so he can get there. Now it’s muddy and I keep sliding back down. We finally make it to the top and we’re both covered with mud. I see the son is beside his dad. I turn around and go inside the house to clean myself up. As I’m doing this, I notice that mud has been tracked into the house - into the kitchen and dining room. I want to clean it up and wonder how it got in here. I realize that his dead son has been walking through the house. I have something in my hand - I think it’s a cloth to wipe up the mud with. I notice that already there’s potato bugs and worms crawling around. The worms are like maggots. They’re stretching themselves across the floor, then shrinking up into smaller things. They’re migrating rather quickly. Then the cat comes in and starts walking though it. I’m like, “No! Stop, stop!” The cat goes backwards, but doesn’t see where it’s going and it falls all the way down the stairs. I’m like oh no! I run down the stairs and pick up the cat. It’s fine, but I feel horrible for yelling at it. I’m cradling it in my arms and see that it’s got two blue pieces of paper in its eyes keeping its eyelids open. One of the papers is frayed enough that I can just grab it in between my fingernails and pull it out. Th...",

    "Dream": "“The Bird Cage” In this dream, I am in an apartment building and my neighbor has asked me to feed his dog while he’s away. He’s not away for very long, just a couple hours. So when I enter the apartment, the door is not locked. In fact, it’s ajar. The dog is just lying down on the floor. He has birds in a birdcage. The birds are making a really loud noise. As I approach the birdcage, I notice the door is wide open. The cage is rectangular, 2 feet long, a foot high, and a foot deep. So the door is 2 foot by 1 foot and is open. Yet the birds don’t try to leave. The song is not the song they would normally make and this puzzles me. There’s a mixture of birds - pigeons, song birds, sparrows. None of them are making their song. It’s this rapid alarm noise and they’re all making it despite different species, which also puzzles me. I wonder if they’re afraid of the dog. But I’ve been in this apartment before visiting, and I know that the birds and the dog will sit together on the floor, so I don’t think that’s the reason. So I feed the dog. Then I wonder why he hasn’t asked me to feed the birds. I look around to see if there’s any food and there isn’t. Then I’m curious about this noise they’re making again. And I wonder why they don’t fly out of the cage because they sound afraid to me. As I get closer to the cage, their noise stops. As I back away, it gets louder. I wonder if I should stay to comfort them. Then the dream just ends.",

    "Dream": "“The Swan Costume” In this dream, I’m in Spain, I think. It’s a warm balmy country and although I don't see the ocean, I feel it in the air. The place I’m in is a palazzo. Everything is made of stucco -hardened and painted these warm brilliant colors like deep red and deep orange. The floor is also made of the same thing, but it’s painted a deep grey. IIn this dream I am Spanish. My skin is darker, my hair is a dark brown. I work as part of a family and with my family in this palazzo. My father is a police officer. He’s investigating some kind of credit card crime. He has stolen credit cards tucked into a book that’s like a photo album that closes with a zipper and is leather. Sometimes he asks me to get it and move it from its secure location up to where he is because he is missing some aspects of this case. The other thing I do is I get him some other materials. It’s like he’s training me to be an investigator. So I do this running around the palazzo in different rooms on different floors for him. Then at one point, in the dream, it deviates. I’m in a different country. I'm a different person. I’m in a kitchen scene where I’m trying to get my sibling to help me with the dishes. There are two sinks - one on an island and one on a counter. There are piles and piles of dishes. My sibling keeps only washing one dish then sitting down on the floor. I keep washing 50 then turning around and there’s only 1. My sibling is supposed to be doing this at the island and I’m supposed to be doing this at the other sink. Then I’m putting them away in a pantry in a slightly different room around the corner. At one of these times in the pantry, I have a plant. It just suddenly appears in my hand. I’m trying to figure out where it goes in the pantry. I open up a cupboard and it has all these wooden slats that would be part of blinds - like the California shutters you close over your windows. It’s a historical chronology of the evolution of a slat of a blind. I think, “Oh, that’s kin...",

    "Dream": "“Getting Ready to Cast Off” I’m on my friend Lynn’s sailboat. She’s invited a bunch of people to crew for her. We’re going on a trip. As is typical, if possible, people are supposed to get down to the boat early, unpack, get everything ready, then cast off. So I’ve got a small pack with my clothes and necessities in it. I go to where I’m sleeping on the boat and arrange everything. I unpack and secure it so nothing is going to fly around. Then we’re waiting because the wind has died down. We’re waiting for the wind to pick up. There’s a dinghy. Normally dinghies are just the bottom part of a boat. This one has an inflatable mast and sail on it. It’s really silly. I’m on this dinghy and it’s tied off to the middle of the ship. At first I’m just standing on the inflatable outside part. I’m hanging on to the mast and sail. It’s going from one side of the boat, around the bow, down the other side of the boat, to the stern, and it goes back up, around, and down. I’m just lazily going around and around like this. Then I think, “Hmm, I could actually fall asleep here.” I’m in danger of doing so. I think, “Well, I better not fall asleep.” So I lean back for a little and create a little resistance on the rope. Again it wanders from port to bow to starboard to stern and back. I do this for a little while. I think, “Well, I really don't even need this inflatable sailboat.” I twine the rope around the soles of my feet and I climb up it a little bit. Now, because of my body weight, I’m going around from port, bow, starboard, stern quite a bit faster. I’m starting to swing around it. The inflatable dinghy has now just disappeared - it’s not in the dreamscape anymore. I’m swinging around on this rope. I’m really enjoying this swinging part. So I move with the momentum, the way you would do with your body if you were on a swing. I’m moving with my core in order to get it to move faster, and I’m flying quite quickly through the air now. I start to laugh because it feels really good ...",

    "Dream": "“The Lost Girl” This was a nightmare, definitely odd. The thing that made it odd is that when I woke up, I was frozen and thought I actually had a little girl with me and the only dream I had last night was with my ex throwing my son’s camping equipment in the garbage. It was like a dream in a dream. When I thought I was awake, the dream I recalled was going camping and spreading a round blanket out on the ground, and then sleeping bag on top of that. This is what my son slept in. His dad was to pick him up that day and take him overnight from the campground. So I rolled up the ground sheet and the round blanket. There was another layer, like a spongy mat you sleep on top of. They were all circular. I rolled them all up and put them in the back of my son’s dad’s car. Instead of them actually driving away, I’m in the backseat. As I see them approach his house, he pulls over first. It’s like a dumpster in the back of a store - a really big kind for large stores. He takes the roll of my son’s sleeping stuff out of the trunk and throws it in the dumpster. I said, “What are you doing? Why would you do that?” He said, “Because it was dirty.” I say, “That’s what washing machines are for.” He just shrugged his shoulder and said it doesn’t matter. I said, “It does matter! We go camping all the time. I’m going to need that.” He just didn’t respond. So I took a piece of paper and wrote down the three items on it and put them in my son’s pocket and said, “Next time we go camping, you’re going to have to replace that.” Then, a few minutes later, I checked my son’s pocket. The note was gone and his dad had thrown it in the garbage. This was very upsetting to me. Then I arrived home. My son didn’t even stay overnight at his dad’s, we just got out of the car and came back into my house. I am in the living room of my house and just sitting there. All of a sudden, this family appears around me. In the dream, they’re mine, but they aren’t my actual family. There are parents and they t...",

    "Dream": "“The Reunion” I’m invited to some kind of gathering, I don’t know what the purpose is, except that I feel I should go. I have a little hesitancy about this because it’s enough of a drive for me that I’m thinking that by the time I get there, I’m going to have to turn around and come back or sleep overnight, which I haven't been invited to do. I’m wondering if I really want to drive basically all night only to stay for an hour. But because I think I should go, I get in my car after putting a few things together in a bag. A couple of things are what you would bring as a hostess gift. I think there’s a bottle of wine - there’s something in a bottle anyway - and something else wrapped up in a small bag. In fact I’ve got a couple of other small bags. When I arrive I just park the car. I’ve never been to this house before. I walk in and see some people that I don’t know very well but I recognize them. There's about 10 or 15 of these. I see that there’s a friend I used to be close to, but am no longer. I see that Omar’s brother, Mike is there. I haven't seen him in a long time. He’s the one person I do have warm feelings towards. So I go sit beside him. He sees me, stands up and gives me a hug and says, “it’s been a long time.” I say, “Yes it has.” We sit down next to each other and we’re getting caught up. Then it appears that the meal is about to start and we’re asked to take our seats. Unfortunately, there’s a seating plan and I have to look for where my name is. I see that I’m seated beside a woman I used to be close with and am no longer, and the person on the other side is someone I don’t know. So I’m not very happy about this. She’s apparently acting as though she’s happy to see me and is quite chatty. She’s acting as though nothing has happened between us. I feel my inner eyes roll at this. I don't want to interact with her or pretend like there’s nothing wrong. The dinner progresses. I realize I haven’t given the hostess the things I brought, so I excuse myself fr...",

    "Dream": "“The Birthday Party” I’m at a house and the occasion is my friend’s birthday. She’s 50 on this birthday, although I don’t think that’s her real age. It’s a larger celebration with more people than normal. Many of them I don’t know. Because of this, her interactions with me are less frequent than they normally would be as she is running around greeting all the guests. I’m looking for someone I know. I’m reluctant to go into the house. I’ve arrived there with my son. He’s playing with some of the other kids of the people I don’t know. I have an eye on him. He’s about 4 or 5 years old in the dream. I know where he is and I can see he’s fine. I’m sitting on the grass enjoying the sun on my skin. I’m noticing the plants she has planted in her garden. I’m waiting for some of the people to greet her and settle somewhere, so we can have a conversation and I can give her the gift that I brought. However this doesn’t seem to be happening as there are a lot of people coming and going. So I decide to go for a walk. I look for my son. He’s not outside anymore. I ask someone if they’ve seen him. They say, “Yes, he went down that hallway.” They indicate with their finger which hallway. So I go down there, looking in the rooms with open doors. I realize that my friend’s husband is in the bathroom. I do not want to run into him. I’m hoping I’ll find my son soon. I see my son in a different bathroom across the hallway from the bathroom where her husband is in. My son is playing in the water. He’s taken off all his clothes. I ask him if he’ll get dressed and I tell him we’re going for a walk. He complies but is taking a really long time to do it. While he’s doing that, I exit the bathroom, continue walking down the hallway to the very last room and see my friend in there sitting and talking with a couple of women. She waves me over and I sit in a chair beside her. The conversation they started before I came into the room continues. It’s not about anything I care to converse about. It’...",

    "Dream": "“The Curio Shop” My kids and I have ridden our bicycles to this shop on a street where everything is closing down. The whole street is closing down and everything is 50-80% off. We need some spoons. I’m hoping I can get some yarn. So we go to the Curio Shop. It’s the kind of store that is packed with all kinds of stuff in it. There are a lot of people in it, too - about four shopkeepers, a couple men, a couple women. The walls go up really, really high. You can’t even see what’s on the top shelves. My kids are looking at various things. I feel pulled in different directions. I also don’t want them to get involved in looking at stuff. We’re only there to get yarn and a spoon. They’re being pulled towards the back of the shop and the spoons are in a jar in the front of the shop. I go back to get them. The floor slopes downwards like a loading ramp at the back of the shop. One of my kids is stuck there. I notice that there is some really dirty murky water. There are creatures that live in the water. One of them has reached up and has a hold of one of my children and is starting to pull him into the murky water. So we pull him - we’ve got his arms and legs. Instead of pulling just him up, this strange creature that's attached to him comes with him. I don’t know how to describe it. It’s purple, but it’s red, but it’s blue. It’s got fur all over. The fur doesn’t look soft. It looks a little bit creepy but also a little bit cute. So now there’s this creature in the store and my son’s got him. I don’t want to put it back in the water because it wants to stay with us and the water looks decidedly evil, so I feel it’s the wrong thing to do. So we carry on. We go back towards the front of the store and finally the line has moved. I see the wooden spoons with long handles for stirring things in a big pot. The crowd around is gone. I look at the price and even though they’re half off, they’re still really expensive and I don’t think I need a spoon that badly. I don’t want to spe...",

    "Dream": "“Angry Mob” All I remember is standing by feeling helpless while watching an angry mob. They were weaponized with sticks, clubs, baseball bats, things you could pound on with. They were filing up the street angrily shouting and it was a street that looked like a suburban street. They were smashing the cars that were parallel parked, smashing the hoods of the cars, breaking all the glass in the windows, getting on top of the cars and smashing the roofs and just going up the street doing this. In the dream, I watch this, feeling helpless to stop. I can’t permeate the crowd. I have nothing to protect myself with. Then the crowd is gone - they continued up the street and are out of sight now. I’m standing while other people come out of hiding. They are commenting on the damage. Somebody says, “I know who the first two cars belong to. The first one belongs to the president of yoga and the second one belongs to the vice president.”",

    "Dream": "“The Vegetable Garden” I’m in the backyard of the house I grew up in. I’m maybe about 20 years old, possibly a little bit younger. I’m with my dad. He’s teaching me how to grow a vegetable garden. The plot is quite large. There’s room for enough vegetables that will have to be kept over the winter. It will definitely feed maybe 6-8 people for a whole year. It's planned out quite meticulously with companion planting as well as staggered planting so that you don’t get a bumper crop of the same thing all at once. There’s corn and cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, cauliflower, beets, carrots, squash, lettuce, rhubarb, and herbs; and marigolds and chrysanthemums around the outside as a natural insecticide. Once it gets planted, which is quite a lengthy process, then we have to go back in and set up structures that will support the things as they grow upwards. There is something that looks like it’s for tomatoes, but it’s not in the tomato row. It’s suspended and there’s little baskets. I can’t figure out how it’s suspended because there’s nothing above it except sky. Then when I look at it, there are bits of other vegetables in it. I can see that there are pieces of cauliflower, so I’m puzzling over this. It also spins. There are about four of these on a long bar. I ask my dad what it is. He keeps appearing. Although I’ve done this all by myself, whenever I’m not sure what I’m doing, my dad just appears for guidance. While I’m puzzling over this, suddenly he is there again. I say, “What’s this for?” He says, “The vegetables on it are composting. The gas they emit is good for the atmosphere that the other vegetables are growing in. It’s like a Natural Miracle Grower.” I think, “Oh. Hmm, I didn't think methane was good to be near people.” So I get this garden going. There’s also another part where I’m fertilizing or something. It’s like an extension of the natural compost where I’m taking some of the pieces from the plants - like when you prune or something starts to grow and t...",

    "Dream": "“Keep it Small” There’s some kind of outdoor grouping. There’s a bunch of small groups and in makeshift tents that vendors put up. There are a whole bunch of these scattered about a piece of land. There are a lot of people. I’m not there to particularly attend. It’s a program of events going on. Each tent has something else going on in it. I seem to be doing my own thing. As I’m walking down the middle of all these tents, I see one with a person leading a discussion. I see one of my son’s friend’s moms, Melissa. She’s Noah’s mom. She’s sitting and listening, attending one of these discussions. I go in and sit down. The leader of the discussion is telling people that shows of emotion are problematic and that people who do this are making social issues seem worse than they actually are, even small things like using two exclamation marks and spamming emojis contribute to this exaggeration of emotion. The lecturer is pointing how this is bringing the whole of society down. And then the lecturer points out: “Here are ways you can change your overly emotional behavior and start to tone it down, keep it small, don’t react.” The lecturer doesn’t actually have a gender, they are androgenous. They say, “And this is how you can keep it out of your face.” I look over at Melissa and I notice that her face looks so much more serious, and she normally looks very expressive and happy. The lecture is over now. I linger waiting to speak with her. Of course she sees me, but doesn’t react and walk over. So I go over and sit with her. I’m asking her: “Are you buying into this? What do you think?” She says, “Oh, I’ve been doing this for some time now.” She shows me a couple examples of her recent writing. Then she tells me that she is also practicing it in terms of celibacy. She hasn’t had any “action” in quite a few months. I say, “Well, maybe that’s making it easier to be less emotional and less expressive, but when you do have intimacy and share with someone again, you’re going to hav...",

    "Dream": "“Survival Juice” This dream begins with me driving through the town I lived in with my biological mother. I’m making a circle around the downtown area. I’ve driven down Kent St and have turned left onto William, then turn right on Russell, left on Lindsey St, left on Kent and right on William. Then I turn the car around so I’m traveling back up William to Kent St. I turn left on Kent, left on Lindsey St and then go behind the stores to a little parking lot and leave my car there. Now I’m on foot and I have both of my kids. I walk back through the same route. As I’m going past a building on William St, I tell my kids that it used to be an old hotel that dates back to the time of the Orangemen and the structure of it at the very bottom is based in intolerance and hate and that I believe it has influenced every other business that has been built on top of it since the late 1800s. A man is listening or he just overhears and argues. He says, “There was nothing there before the 1970s. I tell him, “No, that’s incorrect. I worked here for a very short period of time a long, long time ago. I’ve seen those exact roots.” When I’m saying “roots” I’m picturing old brick at the bottom that I’ve seen with my own eyes. He contradicts me and says that isn’t so. I just walk away because I know there’s no point arguing with somebody who doesn’t know anything and who’s like that. He sits down at this patio table with two of his friends and the server brings out three burgers and they all have a different kind of topping and they all have a different name. She names them as she lays them down on the table. I look and see they are all just burgers. We continue on foot around the route I already described. When we get to the back of the storefronts where I parked the car, I ask my kids if they’re hungry because we’ve been walking around and it’s quite hot out. They say they do. I take them to this tiny place up the street that serves fish and chips. Then, the dream shifts. I’m making up s...",

It’s not clear where I’m going except that once we get onto the plane, I see this mental map of where it’s going and what countries I’m passing. It feels like we’re on our way to New Zealand. At the airport, I don’t realize that we have to take some kind of shuttle. I’m unclear as to why we have to take a shuttle when we’re already at the airport. However, it’s included with our ticket. We wait in this line. There are six of us and tons of other people. It’s packed. I guess there’s a number of shuttles because we wait, the crowd moves, we wait again, the crowd moves. So, as we are moving again I’m thinking, “Okay, this time we’re actually going to get on the shutte.” The shuttle is shaped like a mini airplane. The cockpit area is very short and then there is a little bit wider area. The seats in the cockpit area are like parallel parking - there are five on each side and once you get in, you’d be facing each other. Then the seats are more facing forward like an actual airplane with two and an aisle and two more. They’re facing the cockpit. I get separated from my friends because there are only five seats in the cockpit area. I have to sit in the first row of seats facing forward. I look over and who sits beside me but Donald Trump. I am completely horrified. I’m trying to squish myself as close to the side of the plane as I can. I’m just in shock, thinking: “How did this happen, how did this happen, how did this happen?” I keep thinking I'm In a plane but it’s taxiing down a major highway. I’m so invested in the idea that it’s a plane and it’s taxiing that when we’re going through traffic, I’m thinking the wings are going to be clipped off. I have to keep reminding myself that we’re not on the plane yet. Because I’m sitting beside Donald Trump, there are reporters and people with cameras and other people behind us that are trying to take pictures. That’s why I’m trying to shrink away from him - I don’t...",

I go outside the building to get some air. I notice that I’m really depressed. I was depressed in the gym. I’m depressed outside. I feel detached from all the people around me. I don’t want to be there. The air is dusty and feels dirty. Then my brother swings by to where I’m standing. He asks if I can help him out for a few minutes. I say, “Well I have to be back here at 7 to teach.” He says, “That’s fine. We’ll be back in plenty of time.” I get in the car with him. Immediately, it’s like he’s driving with this really rash intent to get somewhere really quickly. I feel the car is moving more quickly than is safe. Immediately he goes right onto a 7-lane highway. He races over and we stop at a gas station parking lot and there’s a trailer. He asks me if I will hook the trailer to the ball and hitch at the back of the car. I say, “Sure.” I get out of the car. I pick up the end of the trailer with the female end. I think, “Hmm, I wonder if I can lift this without him.” It lifts really easily and I think it’s odd because it should be heavier than this. As I go to attach it to the male end at the back of the car, I notice both ends are made of plastic and realize that’s why it felt too light. As I set the female part on top of the male part, there’s a little cap that’s not quite big enough to reach over the top of the ball. There’s no resounding click when it makes contact. There’s no side pinions that go down through the top to the bottom like there normally would be. Of course, they would have been made of metal, but they’re not. As I’m doing this, I’m picturing the metal one and what the parts and pieces would look like. I’m thinking, “Oh no. This is not good.” I yell into my brother, “Do you know this is made of plastic?” He says, “Yes. It will be fine. Don’t worry about it.” I detach and reattach it a coupl...",

    "Dream": "“The Long Night” I’m riding my bike. I put a few things in my backpack. I notice that I’m wearing long pants and a long sleeved shirt. It’s dark. I ride my bike all the way from one end of town to the other. The town ends. I keep riding. I come to the home of my daughter’s boyfriend’s parents. I stop there for a little bit. The mom’s sister is there, too. I feel detached from them in some way. I think they’re talking about something that’s racist. Because I’m kind of detached, they don’t really care if I’m there or not. I get back on my bicycle and leave. I keep riding. It’s still dark. I’m getting tired. Then I stop at a building. I go in. Inside are the studio owners of a place I used to teach at, but don’t anymore because of their unethical way of scheduling their staff. The building isn’t a studio though, it’s just this long building. They both appear to be busy with other tasks. The building is a long rectangle. I think I’m just there to rest. There isn’t anything in it. I’m not talking to the owners, I'm just standing there. Suddenly there’s a counter, like you’d see at a bank. They’re each on one side of the counter. A woman comes up to the counter. Now I’m on the same side as one of them. She is busy and writing in some kind of big ledger. The woman asks a question. Now I see that I have some tickets in my hand. I tell her that it’s a raffle for my son’s hockey team. She says, “Oh, in that case, I’ll buy tickets.” I’m writing her name on them and then ripping them out of the booklet. I hand her the tickets and say, “He’s also in theatre. I know it’s an odd combination - hockey and theatre.” She says, “No, my son does the same thing. It’s nice to have boys who are interested in both.” We start talking together and leave. I realize I need to use the washroom. I go into the washroom and the other woman does, too. She’s in the stall next to me. I’m getting toilet paper off the roll on the wall, but it’s not really toilet paper. It’s actually thick towels. I hear...",

    "Dream": "“Mayoral Politic” This dream is more of a thematic than a narrative. It looked like one of those old fashioned great big signs when you enter a town where it has the mayor’s face on it, then a story about the town. It was like a threshold or portal or lived experience rather than just a great big giant sign. It looked old, too, it had an oval shape to the story, the painted picture of the mayor was in the upper left hand side. I’m looking at a description, but it’s also an entry into a town. So it’s not two-dimensional. On the description is a comparison of a mayor and the lifestyle of someone involved in a subculture and has a motorcycle. The mayor is female. She looks like she’s had a life of outdoors - there’s a sun-kissed color to her skin. She has short blonde wavy and dense hair. She looks like she would be a muscular person even though the picture only has her face. The description is like a political analysis of someone who is mayor of a town and removed from that duty that caters to the idea of mayor but stays in the office and doesn’t really interact - maybe like how clueless the aristocracy was to the plight of the common people. So it’s a comparison between mayoral duties that are detached and removed from what people need as opposed to someone who is more rebellious of that polite culture, rides a motorcycle, but is simultaneously responsive to the needs of the town and then is praised. But the praise is lie: despite the fact that there is a motorcycle, there are a number of positive qualities that the mayor has. It’s not two-dimensional in that I’m reading this. I’m feeling it as a lived experience in my body when these two descriptions are compared and contrasted. It’s like an entryway into that experience. I consider them from how my body feels about them, then decide that I would rather live in a place with a mayor that rides a motorcycle and is somewhat rebellious but responsive, than the mayor that caters to polite society but is cluelessly privil...",

    "Dream": "“Grapefruits in Church and Racecars in the Water” This dream starts in my house. It’s not the house I currently live in; it’s not a house I’m familiar with at all. I’m in the kitchen and my daughter is with me. We are talking as though we haven't been anywhere in a long time. We are aware that there is a church nearby and lots of people have given us good feedback on it and we know that the group that goes there is really involved in a lot of things in the community. So even though church has not been something that we’ve had favorable ideas about in the past, we decide to give it a try. It’s Sunday. We walk to the church. The church is enormous. It’s beautiful. It’s built of stone; it looks like hand-hewn rock. It rises really high up into the sky. On the front of it, there is a really large stained glass window in the shape of a rose. There are spires around the outside of it that also rise straight up. The doors are all hewn wood. The wood is so thick and the doors are bigger than normal. This is what you see from the outside. The church probably takes up a whole block. The doors are open. People are starting to file in. The faces aref friendly. There is such a multicultural, multi demographic of people of gender and age and they just reflect such a wide variety of life. My daughter and I look at each other; we smile, but we don’t say anything. We’re thinking, “Yep, this is going to be good.” We go in. There’s an older woman who is taking people’s names. She’s asking questions about our interest. She notes these on a clipboard then directs us to go upstairs. She also tells which room to go to when the service is over. She is clumping people by interest. We walk up a really wide staircase - it’s probably three staircases wide - and it creaks under my feet. The creaking is like an orchestra because there are a lot of people and as each person’s foot lands on the stairs, the stairs make a creak. So it’s a symphony of creaks. The staircase winds around. I can feel th...",

My eyes are rounder and they’re sunken way back into my head. It’s like I have no eyebrows and now eyelashes. They’re just sunken. Yet at the same time, they seem to be outlined with makeup or some kind of eyeliner just around the lids. The face shield is not right on my face; it’s an inch away from my face. It’s made out of hard material like a lampshade would have been made of. It’s kind of waxed.",

    "Dream": "“The Cold Water” I’m in a large ranch style log house. There is a lot of iron made stuff and stuff made out of wood. There are really old fashioned cooking implements nailed to the wall. There are farming pieces and sides all made of iron and hand-hammered - you can see the little pound marks and everything. It stretches from the eating area through what would be the kitchen area into a longer gathering place where there are other rooms that are dark - I can’t see what’s in them but I think they are bedrooms. I’m standing in that area. I’ve walked in through the front door, through the parlor, through the kitchen area, and now I’m standing in the back parlor. Other people are there and in my dream I know them but I don’t recognize them with my conscious mind to give them a name now. They’re dressing in various kinds of wetsuits. They have diving equipment and masks. Some of the wetsuits are the short ones, some are longer in the leg. The idea is to go out snorkeling or diving into the stream that runs on the property behind the ranch house. I feel like I’m ready to go and I’m confident. So, I walk out and it’s winter. There’s snow on the ground. I walk out the door along the snow, along the bank of the river, until I get to the point where it’s been decided that I will enter. Everyone is entering at a different place. I start to climb down a river bank that’s probably about four feet high. I’m backing down on my stomach. Where my feet are supposed to hit solid ground, they don’t. It breaks from underneath the weight of my body, but there’s so much of my body already over the embankment that I can’t pull myself back up and I just slip down into the freezing icy cold water. I’m trying to shout for help. I can feel my limbs starting to freeze. But nothing comes out of my throat. I keep trying to shout louder but my voice won’t obey my emotion. I’m trying to say help and I’m trying to say I’m cold, but nothing comes out. I can see people around me but they aren’t notici...",

    "Dream": "“The Line Up” I’m in a doctor’s office but it’s actually some kind of ear specialty clinic. I’ve had an issue with my ears. My appointment was for 8am. I get there and am with a friend, a female friend. We’re sitting on a bench outside of the office. There’s a parallel line up, not part of the ear clinic but beside it where people are lined up to pay their gas bill. Their line up goes all the way down the sidewalk, wraps around the bottom of the hill where the traffic lights are and continues down the other side of the road and around the buildings then vanishes out of sight. I comment that if it weren’t traffic, the line would be graceful as it wraps around the urban setting. I comment to my friend that what we’re looking at is the demographic of people who don’t believe in paying their bills online or don’t trust banks. She makes some kind of argument but I can’t remember what it is now. I debate back that yes, I see your point but we’re still looking at that demographic. I try and study it. I'm looking at the pole., their faces, what they’re wearing, and trying to listen to snippets of their conversation. It’s mostly elderly people. But there’s also a middle aged group of scruffy looking men. I notice millennials there as well. Then our number gets called and we enter the ear clinic. We have another line up in there. It’s now 11:30am and my appointment was scheduled for 8. I’m starting to get hungry and feel frustrated. Then it’s 3pm. I’m still not there. There are about four people ahead of me and I know the clinic closes at 5. I approach the desk and say, “My appointment was at 8. It’s 3pm. I’m really getting tired and hungry and thirsty. What's going on?” The receptionist who looks like my son’s counselor crawls underneath the desk and speaks to me from there. She says, “I’m really sorry. This isn’t by my design. People get upset by this all the time. They do this every time. Everyone’s appointment was scheduled for 8am.” I feel like screaming at her but I don...",

    "Dream": "“For a Little While” I’m in a village. It’s a small community. People live close to each other. There is not a lot of space. People don’t live in houses. It’s outside living. People’s space is defined by what they have in it, which is mostly contained to sleeping quarters and the belongings they have that are necessary for daily life. My area is quite comfortable. I’m happy with it. I feel content. My sleeping area is soft, spacious. The covers are warm; it’s under my head and supports it and I have plenty of it. I am walking through the village holding the hand of a small child. I’m walking slowly to adjust to her pace. My heart, my body is full of love for her. I’m waiting for her dad. I know he’s there but he’s invisible. He has a presence but I haven’t seen him with my eyes yet. The time goes very very fast. A number of days blend into one moment. At this particular moment in time, I feel someone around me and behind me on the path where we’re walking. Today he materialises. I see him in the flesh. I feel my own flesh respond to his physical presence. I’m really happy to see him. We walk together for some time, hand in hand, enjoying being on a walk in the body. Then the village gradually gets a little closer together as the sun sets in the sky. It’s time for us to return to the sleeping quarters. As we approach, there’s food you can eat with your fingers that’s warm and savory. We both unwrap a small package of food that maybe fits in your hand. We eat it with our fingers. The packages are like skins. We squeeze them shut and set them down around the boundaries of our sleeping area. The things we’ve stacked around the sleeping area - our belongings - give us just enough privacy. Everyone goes to their sleeping quarters at the same time so there’s privacy from everyone else’s eyes for everyone. I feel the anticipation of being able to share our bodies tonight. The experience is very electric and satisfying. It creates a feeling of zest to taste life again. Then ...",

    "Dream": "“Grief and Ash” I’m having a conversation with a woman that continues despite the fact that I need to use the washroom. It continues despite the fact that I’m sitting on the toilet and pushing something out of my body. I’m pushing shit out of my body. I don't have to strain too hard. My body does evacuate it pretty effortlessly. I can hear other people in the house but it’s more like white noise rather than distinct conversation. Then the person I’m talking to continues talking about mundane topics as though I’m not sitting on the toilet and I’m not evacuating shit from my body. I can feel my body is finished. Then I take the toilet paper from the roll on the wall, nothing unusual. As I try and wipe the remnants of it from myself, it feels like there’s gritty stuff like seeds. I wipe again. Now instead of there being less on the paper, there’s more. I repeat this process about six times. There’s more each time. I feel like it’s spreading it around the cheeks of my bum. And so, I think that this process is spreading it around me more. I don’t want to continue it. I need to go somewhere else where I can get clean. I tell the woman, “I can’t talk to you right now. I need to stop this.” She does leave. I take off all my clothes and get into the shower. I scrub myself from head to toe. I realize that the shower, the water, the soap is making me clean. I stop, rinse myself off and get out. I towel myself off. I feel clean now. But I’m disgusted at my clothes. I think they carry something. I put them in the washing machine in the bathroom, add some soap, turn the water on and start them. Then the dream continues on. I just can’t pull any more out of it.",

    "Dream": "“The Scavenger Hunt” I’m in this outdoor space. It’s like a big hill. There are a lot of rocks on the hill. There is some low growing grass. It’s like rolling lowlands. There are some flat spaces but also lots of places to climb. The trees are more like evergreen trees; they’re conifers. I don’t recall any deciduous trees at all. I’m with some people. We are tasked with finding these red marks. Each red mark indicates that there’s something hidden there and we have to follow the instructions or use the thing that’s hidden for the purpose that it’s hidden for. There is a bit of gathering as we get into very small groups of just one or two people. Some people are going off on their own. At the bottom of the hill is some kind of night vision glass that if you look through it, you can see where the red marks are. You can’t see the marks unless you’re looking through the glass. So, you have to remember where they are then start to weave your way up the hill and climb over the rocks, sometimes on hands and knees. Some of it is really steep and people are grabbing onto immature trees to help pull themselves up. We don’t have any equipment. We’re wearing clothes and we have to figure out how to navigate through the landscape on our own. Then once you get there, you just feel around with your hand or look with your eyes to discern if there’s some item that’s not natural. Some of them are tricky. For example, one of the items is simply some food. So where the red dot was is a piece of fish food then close by to where it was found, the rock is like a mouth of a cave. We crawl in. Really close to the mouth of the cave is a deep, deep pool. There’s a large fish in there, probably about three feet long and has teeth. What’s the natural food you do with fish food if there’s a fish? Feed it. So, the person that I’m with feeds the fish. I think she better get her hand back quickly because that fish has a lot of rows of pointy teeth and it’s a carnivorous fish. She does. She feeds it...",

I’m suddenly standing rooted on the side of a road. Suddenly a man appears and leaps over the shoulder and yanks something out from the forest at the side of the road. The forest goes right to the shoulder. He pulls out something that I at first think is an animal. And all in one second, he takes a knife out of his pocket and he guts it, making a long sharp blade from the top to the bottom. The contents spill out the way people do when they gut a shark and tires and all that kind of stuff from the bottom of the ocean that ends up in the belly of a shark pulls out on the side of the road. There’s liquid or digestive juices with it. I’m horrified for a moment, then I think: “Wait a minute, that’s not an animal, that’s a backpack!” The things that came out of it are equipment, like flashlights, a little rope and cans of emergency food. It’s a survival kit. But it was gutted. He didn’t open it with a zipper.",

We’re not there for me to look for a job and I’m not working there. We’re just there because he’s hungry. He’s eating a salad. Overtop of the booth, I see one of the people I used to work with. He’s in uniform. I peak up over the booth. We make eye contact and say, “Hey. Wow, I haven’t seen you in so long.” I ask him, “Are you working here again?” He says, “Yes.” I say, “So they’re hiring again?” There’s been some kind of hiring freeze. He says, “Yes.” I wonder if they’ll rehire me because I really need a job. I look to see who the manager is. I’m looking around the floor from my seat and see that it’s George. He had stopped working there just shortly before I did. So I’m also surprised. Eventually he comes back to the pizza oven. We make eye contact and I wave to him and say, “Hey, when did you start working here again?” He says, “Not that long ago.” I say, “Would you take an application from me?” He says, “Here, I’m too busy to talk. Just follow me around for a little while.” So I do. We go back into the prep area and into the walk-in fridge. I’m trying to find out who the owner is and if it’s the same ones who bought it when we all left our jobs. He says, “It is the same ones, but…” and he doesn’t finish the rest of the sentence. I see a couple of other people I have not seen since high school and one who never worked at the restaurant, but he’s sitting there dressed in prep clothes. So, I’m waiting for George to finish the sentence and he goes into the dish pit. I follow him. I grab a few dishes because it’s really busy and I’m starting to help out. We go back into the area where we pick up the food plates. We go over to the bar. While he’s doing something there I put some dirty glasses into the dishwasher.

I can see it from the outside - the big wide stairs, the huge pillars, the giant doors, the big spacious hallways that are made of marble, the floor is really slippery and looks wet but it is not. This is the part where I’m not sure if I’m just observing or if I’m one of the people. In the hallway there are just a couple of people. I’m walking through it trying to find some justice. I can feel this tight ball of outrage mixed with grief in the middle of my chest. I wonder which courtroom I’m supposed to be in. As I'm looking at each door, I’m looking for some sign that this will be where my case will be heard. There starts to be more than just one or two people in the hallway. Now there’s four, then eight, then sixteen; they’re multiplying exponentially. Then they’re starting to talk to each other. The voices sound aggressive. I notice at first that it’s all just men. Then there are so many that there’s no longer any distance between who I am and the rest of the men. They’re only inches away from me and now there’s even more. I’m starting to see facial features. They all look kind of angry. Then someone says, “These aren't regular men. Look, this man’s gay.” As soon as those words are uttered, the crowd turns in upon itself. Someone starts throwing a punch at the other one. Then there’s a punch thrown back. Then just as quickly as the crowd multiplied exponentially, so do the punches. Then some of them start running. They’re running down the hallway. Because the marble floors are so slippery, there’s this sideways running. During the sideways running, the part of the crowd that’s chasing almost catches up. I fear that they’re going to be killed. There are so many chasing them that if they catch them, that’s the end of it.

The height is a bit dizzying and I can feel a bit nervous when I come out onto the balcony in terms of not being safe at that height. But I start to get used to it after I do it a few times. I’m living there with my baby, it feels like my first born child. I’m not quite used to how to do things with a baby to organize my time. I’m working online. I only have one room - it’s a kitchen and living room with a little area for a crib and the things the baby needs. I have a table with my laptop on it and other things that I think I’m going to need to teach online. My baby won’t sleep very well. She’s very sensitive to not being held. So she relaxes and closes her eyes after she nurses, but as soon as I set her down, no matter how slowly I do it, she wakes up once she’s in her crib. She doesn’t cry very much. She’s very quiet. She’s just sensitive. I’ve tried wrapping her up so she feels like she’s still bundled. That maybe lasts for another sixty seconds once she gets in her crib, but she still wakes up. I end up carrying her around on my left hip quite a bit. Other than the fact that I’m worried she’s not sleeping enough, this is okay because she is quiet when I’m teaching. I’m teaching online various things. I’m training teachers. I’m also hosting my own classes and making meditations. I’m trying to reduce twenty-minute meditations into a five-minute trailer so that they will interest people into purchasing the twenty-minute and the five-minute trailers are free. As I’m doing this, I also have students live, at least I think they’re live. It kind of feels like a hologram, but they’re still learning from me online but they’re a hologram and I can see them in my apartment. They’re leading their own programs in other places. Someone has some managerial duties for when those programs are released. I can see her there and it’s my old boss. She’s h...",

I’m holding it vertical to the ground, not parallel with it. It’s already been opened and played so every so often I have to check to be sure the bottom hasn’t created an opening between the top and the pieces haven’t fallen out. It’s old and the box doesn’t hold its shape very well because it’s cardboard and gets soft after a while. So I’m holding it this way. I walk out of my home and have my daughter and son with me. There’s somebody else but I can’t remember who it is now. We don’t have any front steps and it’s like a ramp. It actually feels like I’ve left a movie theatre. We turn right and go down the sidewalk. There’s a long line of stores. We’re walking slowly because there are so many people we know and we keep stopping to talk. So we only take about two steps and there’s somebody else and we stop to talk again. We eventually go three or four stores down and there’s somebody else I know. They’re trying to control a crowd of window shoppers because some are trying to make a purchase and some are just standing around and are getting in the way. My family and I stop to help. I set the board game down by the cash register. The store owner has brought everything outside in order to avoid people going in the shop and making a big crowd in there. Part of the issue is that no one browsing is wearing a mask and none are social distancing. Then I realize that my family and I don’t have masks on either. I note this and say, “Well, no wonder! Nobody is wearing a mask!” We take ours out of our pockets and put them on our faces. Then I’m trying to get people to form a line and I tell them, “The cash register is over there and you have to line up.” Gradually people realize they should be social distancing so they’re starting to self-organize. I take a turn at the cash register. They’re giving me cash. It’s not debit. I’m q...",

    "Dream": "“COVID Dream” I’m in the house, it might even be the house I grew up in - it looks like that, it’s a bungalow. I’m with my dad and we’re planning to go to Niagara Falls and spend the day at the amusement park. There are some other kids going, too, and I think they’re just friends of mine. I’m teenage me. I’m talking with my dad about what rides we’re going to go on. We discuss the fact that it’s cold and we’re going to need to wear extra clothes. So there are some conversations about what we’re going to bring because we don’t want to carry too much but we want the right things for the weather. I’m excited about going. My ex-best friend who I was still friends with when I was a teenager, calls on the phone and I tell her that we’re going. She says she’s going to meet us there because she’ll be in the area. She asks me what time we’ll arrive. I tell her we haven’t finished figuring that out yet and I’ll call her back when my dad lets me know. I hang up the phone and it suddenly dawns on me that the reason the amusement park is still open right now and not crowded is one of the reasons we decided to go. It’s not normally open this time of the year when it’s cold and near Christmas. We also wouldn’t go to an amusement park because it’s so crowded and the lineups are too long. I realize that these criteria are in existence because of COVID. It sinks in that we also should not be going. We can't bring all these people together, we can’t circulate through the park. I feel this moment of rebelliousness where I want to go anyway at the same time I know we can’t and we won’t. I voice this to my dad. He doesn’t say anything. He silently realizes the truth of this, too. I pick up the phone and call my friend back and tell her we won’t be going after all. She asks me what I’m going to do. I tell her I’m going to be home but we realized that the reason the amusement park is open later in the year and there’s hardly anyone there is because of COVID so we can’t go.",

    "Dream": "“The Passageway” The property we have is like a winery in the sense that there are wild grape leaves growing everywhere. It’s old. The house is made of stone. There’s a lot of land. We don’t make wine. There is some picking of fruits and a kitchen garden closer to the house, but it’s sustenance farming. We don’t have any animals. The house is vast. We aren’t the first tenants in it. My dad is there, my brother, my sister, and I think my step-mom and other members of the family that are always there. The dream fogs the others out, but I can feel them as bodies and presences. The main characters are my brother and my dad and I until my daughter and her ex-boyfriend arrive. As the dream starts, I’m in the kitchen. Everything is old. I feel like the floor is hard packed earth. The rooms maybe started as one room, which was the kitchen and everybody slept there. Some family added another room and then another room on top of that. So it’s not one big cohesive unit, it’s a whole bunch of different ones. It must be 700 years old. We keep discovering these things we didn’t know were there. I’m using a pup to pump water into the sink to wash dishes. The water is cold, it’s not heated. My dad tells me that we have to go and take stock of what’s in the basement because he has to list the house for sale. My brother and I go down there. The basement is super creepy. There are bugs and things that only move in the dark and webs. No one ever uses it. We have a few things stored down there. There’s no electricity in the whole place. The torch in the torch holder is lit and we each have torches that we hold beside the one in the holder so we each have a light of our own. The only thing we can see is what the torch lights up, so as soon as you move from that spot you can feel the heavy damp of the darkness behind you. I’m sticking pretty close to my brother. There are some old things from when we were babies - the high chair, a trunk, and some other things like that. Then there’s a pa...",

    "Dream": "“Feed Your Eyes” I’m in a hospital waiting room. I have a couple of people with me that feel like friends. It’s my turn to go to the desk and check in. The nurses are continuing to do work in front of us. There are three nurses that are all part of the check-in, so the people who are waiting can go from one to the other or the other to keep the line moving quickly, so it’s not a three part check-in process. The one to my left is moving her line pretty quickly. The one in front of me and the one to my right aren’t doing anything, they’re just writing at their desks. I’m kind of lost in my head, patiently waiting for them to finish up their paperwork, although I am starting to feel uncomfortable on my feet and in and around my hip. I’m thinking there was no point in them calling us up if they weren’t ready to take us. Then I realize that we’ve been standing there for an hour and five minutes. I say, “Excuse me, what are we waiting for? My surgery is supposed to start and I was here at the time I was required.” The nurse in front of me says, “The lights are too bright. We’re waiting for them to dim.” I’m thinking that’s not really reasonable because the lights always look like this. I say, “That’s irrelevant and I need to get to my surgery. Are you going to give me my papers or not?” She huffs and then signs them off and hands them to me. I can overhear her telling one of her colleagues right in front of me that I said the lights weren’t going to get any less bright than they were now and she’s rolling her eyes. I go back to the waiting room and my two companions say, “Wow that was a really long time. I hope you can still make your surgery.” I say, “Yes it was,” and they gather up their things and we go into the area that we’re supposed to go into next. There are a lot of hallways. It’s a very busy ward. I realize I need to use the washroom. There’s someone going into the washroom - it’s someone who has just had surgery and she’s pulling her IV pole along with her. I t...",

    "Dream": "“Daycare” I’m in a daycare setting and I’ve been hired to team teach a class with somebody else who’s female. It’s a hive of activity. There are two large classrooms with a doorway between them, but no door. There is a six-foot space where you can walk between the rooms. There are older kids in the other room. There is another doorway where the bottom half opens separately from the top half. The bottom half is closed, but the top half is open, and there are infants in the other room. I can lean over the half door and see this. I’m doing this when the dream begins. There is a man kneeling on the floor. He looks scared. It also looks like he’s looking for something. I ask him what’s going on. He says to me that there’s a large snake in the room and he’s trying to see where it is, but he’s cleared the babies from the room. I quickly look down at the door to see if there’s a crack underneath that he could have crawled through into this room. But, there’s a thick weather stripping piece across the bottom of the door and I really don’t think it’s possible that anything could squeeze underneath it. I ask him if he wants some help. He tells me yes and then leaves through another door that must lead to another class room a little further away. I realize that it does because he indicated that direction with his arm when he said he cleared all the babies out of the room. So he’s taken them to that room. Then he’s gone. The door shuts behind him. I’m looking for the snake but I see there’s still one baby in there and it’s down at the other end of the room, kind of in the shadows. I start knocking on the door and saying, “There’s a baby in here, there’s a baby in here!” He doesn’t come out. I don’t see a snake but I feel afraid. I grab the baby and take it into the room where I am. There’s a high chair and I put it into the high chair and put the safety straps around it. I’m saying “it” because I have no idea of its gender and I don’t even really see its features, it’s just more...",

    "Dream": "I’m standing in my childhood home, in the living room. Only the living room is visible. All around me is open space and the impression of “house,” but I can’t see it. To my right where there would be a living room wall is just an open space. I can see other houses lined up sitting on a rainbow, each of them moving up into the air. My father and my brother are in the living room with me and they keep trying to push a button that would shift the foundation of our house off and up onto this rainbow that is slowly ratcheting its way around like the hands of a clock. The houses and my house are moving counterclockwise to the left. I do not like this and every time my dad presses the button, I press it again to stop the house from moving off its foundation. It feels like something else has taken over - that something else has said, this is what we’re supposed to be doing - that these houses are supposed to move up off the ground and into space. My dad is telling me that we can’t live on Gaia anymore and it’s not worth the effort to try to save her. She’s too far gone and that is why the houses need to get on this track on this rainbow that has outer space as the background of the sky.",

    "Dream": "I find myself at the house of a friend. I’ve never been to this house before and it’s in a neighborhood of Modern McMansion houses - they are square and blocky with large windows. I’m heading up into this friend’s house and we are going through the home and into her backyard which looks like an obstacle course. There’s people training and it looks like she has been working out or coaching. Her husband is there with their baby. I know both of them, but what’s fascinating is I go up to her and she’s always been shorter than me, but in this dream maybe she’s standing on a stair or something. So when I go to hug her, I can tuck my head under her chin and my face is pressed against the top of her chest and I can feel her heartbeat. There’s something in this hug that’s a little bit more than friendly because there’s literal heat between the two of us that I can feel on my face and I can feel it radiating off her chest right above her heart. The history between this friend and I was not healthy in any way, but this seems like a forgive and forget situation with this hug and we are both very happy to see each other. She’s almost like a little kid. She really wants to show me all the things in her home and obstacle course/training area. I can tell she’s been training because my arm brushes against her arm and the muscles in her arm are so hard, they feel like a rock. I can tell she’s so happy to see me. She’s not reaching out to touch me or hold me on purpose, but I can feel that she wants to, which is fascinating because her husband is standing behind her with their baby. We decide to go somewhere. She wants to show me some other things. I’ve already said hello to the husband and the baby is so cute and adorable. So we all head out to the garage to get into her car. Her car is a Jeep which she used to have and sold in real life. This Jeep is even bigger and the husband and baby get in the back and I sit up in the front seat with her. She goes to pull out of the driveway, bu...",

    "Dream": "My brother (the one born right after me) and I are hanging onto a brown balloon - it’s shaped like a physioball and is big enough for both of us to be laying on it with our stomachs on it and our arms around it. This ball/balloon is floating up so high we can see the Earth and all the continents and oceans. But the ball is slowly losing air and we’re getting lower and lower. It’s getting smaller and we keep readjusting our grip - grabbing more of the ball to pull ourselves back up because it’s getting smaller and our position is not as stable on it. While the ball is getting lower, we’re going over some parts of the land where I can see castle ruins in some places and they look like medieval castles and some look like those gorgeous buildings in Russia. They’re different styles of castles, but it’s all ruins and no humans have been there in a long time. Then we’re floating over the ocean and the ball is getting closer to the ocean. I look down and begin to panic because I can see the ocean is vast and incredibly deep. Both my brother and I do not want to land in that ocean with this balloon. So I manage to adjust the balloon so the part where you blow the air in is near my mouth. I start to blow air into it all while hanging on and floating through the sky. I get the balloon a little bit bigger and before when we were up at space-height we were able to direct which way the balloon was going, but once we got further down, we couldn’t direct it until I blew more air into it. It gives us enough time to have control over its direction long enough to land someplace where there’s water, more land and ruins. These ruins look like metal buildings that are all rusted. We land on a metal ledge and there are huge elephants with really long tusks and they’re essentially killer elephants who are not so happy to see two humans in their territory. It’s very clearly their territory. So now my brother and I have left the balloon and we’re trying to run away. There’s parts we have to...",

    "Dream": "I am with a bunch of my sisters/friends from this timeline and time period and we are at one of their houses. It’s a huge expansive place. The house is big, the front yard is big. There’s a table set up at the front because we are celebrating somebody’s birthday, I’m not sure whose. Maybe we’re celebrating everybody’s birthday. We’re all there with our kids and the kids are running around. There’s lights strung from the trees. The table in the front is a really long picnic table and it's covered with food because we’re all eating at the table. It feels incredibly expansive and joyful. There’s lots of coming and going in and out of the house and lots of conversations happening at the table. I’m kind of wandering around. At one point I notice my daughter is running around with a friend's daughter and my son is somewhere playing in the dirt. I am having a conversation with a good friend. That seems to be the entire point of the dream. At one point I carry more food out to the table and sing happy birthday to somebody - or some sort of congratulation is happening. Then the dreams shifts a little and I’m talking with a friend of mine (in real time and in this timeline) - someone I’ve met over Instagram - but we are face-to-face in this part of the dream and that feels nice because we seem to totally get each other. I'm chatting with her and she all of a sudden says, “Oh, there’s this man I want you to meet.” She says his name and it starts with C - I want to say it’s Cyril or something but I don’t quite catch it. I can feel that a part of me is questioning. The scene around me has changed, too. I’m no longer at this big wide expansive home. I’m at her home and it’s so open. We are standing outside in a driveway and her house is behind her in the backyard and there is a garage to our right. We’re near the garage but we are outside and it is dusk now. A porchlight is on. This guy pulls up on a motorcycle and she’s like, “This is the person I want you to meet.” He’s got thi...",

    "Dream": "Multiple parts to this dream, but only a few that really stand out. I am living in an apartment and across the street is where my ex lives with our kids. He’s selling the house they live in. I’m so sad because they're not going to be closeby anymore and he’s going to be having the kids full time. So I won’t get to see them because they’re not there. But what is the most sad is when I walk over to his house - he invited me over to see if I wanted anything from it because he was selling it furnished with all the things in it, including some of the kids’ stuff and some of his stuff and things I had made for the kids. He was leaving it all there, leaving it up to the realtor to sell the house as furnished. At the time I go over, he’s there with our son and our son is going through all his things, grabbing what he wants and leaving the rest. I’m feeling so heartbroken about it - just the fact that they’re moving and the kids are going to be far away and that there’s all these things that are unwanted, uncared for and untended, including things that I have made for the kids. Oddly enough, my daughter is nowhere to be found in this, she’s already moved on. My son is also not incredibly sad. He’s very pragmatic about what he wants to take with him and go. I’m looking around and the house is full and my ex is just leaving all of it where it is. They both leave and I’m really sad when they leave when I say goodbye to my son because I feel like I’m not going to see him again. That feels heartbreaking. Then I’m standing there in what feels like the wreckage of a life. I’m standing there in the house and the realtor comes with a client and is showing the house. I’m there but it’s almost like they can’t really see me. I think it’s odd that this person is contemplating moving into this place with so much stuff still in it. I leave because it feels so heavy to be in there and I go back across the street to my apartment which is just me. I’m sitting on the balcony. There’s a gorgeou...",

I’m not even totally clear who my companions are. I just know I’m responsible as I’m part of the team trying to keep humanity in general safe - it’s a general feeling of protecting, but I’m not sure who I’m protecting. It’s not anyone in particular, it’s just a group of people, some of whom are my friends and some I don’t know. It is totally a preparation for some sort of standoff or battle because me and the other friends or colleagues are planning and prepping and come up with a battle plan. It totally reminds me of a movie. I don’t even know what's coming for us, I’m not sure, other than that I know that me and some of the others have superpowers and we’re making our plans around the powers we have. One of the people on my side is projecting out this gel that freezes anything that’s coming towards us. So whatever it is that’s coming to attack us starts to attack - they have a green aura around them. This person puts out their gel and it does freeze some of the enemy but doesn’t last. As the battle continues, it’s a full on attack and we have to fall back because we end up not being able to hold our position. It was very dramatic and I can’t even remember if it was missiles being launched at us or what was coming, but it was a life or death situation. Then some other parts of the dream happen. The only thing I can remember of this second part is another group of people and a man who I don’t know and his friend who I also don’t know. The first group I’m watching go into an old fashioned horse and carriage. They load into it from a barn type area and they’re getting a tour of a ranch. I’m not sure what the business is, but they load into this carriage and they go down on the tour. Part of the tour takes them to the entrance to the ranch where there is a big sign that announces the name of it. But this entrance place also ha...",

It’s my friend, Carmen, who is hosting. She’s been doing a lot of the teaching. I’ve been in the mix, too. I’m not a participant, but I’m there. I can’t tell if I’m helping out with the retreat or not. She’s giving the ending teaching or wrap up of the retreat to all these women. They’re mostly older women - a little like elders in training - that seems to be the theme of the retreat. She’s giving them a speech, more or less, that’s along the lines of: “Okay, now you women have these tools. Go forth and do your eldering.” I am witnessing this and someone has asked me to go hang out the laundry, which is something I used to do all the time in Hawaii - I used to hang out all of the laundry for our house. We didn’t have a dryer. Then even when I moved to the mainland, in the summertime I would hang out all of the laundry. When I did it as a child, I resented it because it was just another chore I had to do and it was not my clothes, it was everyone else’s clothes - by everyone else, I mean the 9 other people in my family, so there were a lot of clothes. I am out hanging this laundry now for the retreat and I’m feeling frustration and resentment build because I can hear all the women who have been on this retreat and they’re all complaining. I’m thinking, “Did you not learn anything from what we just did?” They’re all holding hands with each other. They’re all in it together, complaining together, and also completely ignoring the fact that I’m hanging out their laundry. Or maybe not ignoring, but more that’s what I should be doing because I’m not an elder. I am so frustrated because all I can see is how seemingly selfish they are and that they don’t have anything to complain about. They're complaining about parts of the retreat and parts of their lives. I get so sick and fed up that I leave ...",

I’ve been doing emails for her and she's giving me some fabric that’s super cute. I quickly and nonchalantly sew up a top and skirt with the fabric. The skirt and top are cute and match the artwork she’s creating and is showing clients and friends right now. I’m working on emails and greeting cards - getting those uploaded to a computer. She’s in another room doing this meeting. She calls me in and we continue consulting with the client. She asks me where I got the outfit I’m wearing. I say, “This is the fabric you gave me. I turned it into a skirt and top.” It feels good between us - she’s my friend and my boss. We’re having a good time and I’m really enjoying working with her. Then the scene evolves a little bit. We’re in the same house area, but now it’s my house. We’ve completed our work and she leaves. I’m realizing there’s really weird stuff happening outside. I get it in my head that I want to call my ex-father-in-law who owns the mortgage on my house (this is actually true in real life as well). Because weird things are happening, I want to call and say, “Hey, there’s a freeze on all mortgages and rent, so I’m not going to get it to you this month.” I’m on the phone talking to him and I've gone outside. It’s a little bit dark and ominous. It is nighttime. A wind has picked up. I’m talking with him on the phone. There is no hello or anything; I haven’t even gotten out the words to ask him about the freeze. He says, “I haven’t received your rent check this month. And I’ve heard that there’s a drone outside your house and I’m a little bit confused.” He’s starting to fade out like the connection is bad and I can’t hear him anymore. But the gist of what he’s saying is that there’s a drone - somebody has been flying a drone outside my house and filming me. It’s at the windows and it films me....",

I’m feeling a little bit intimidated because they all seem to have these really well paying jobs and lots of prestige and I work at a grocery store. They haven’t said anything, but I’m feeling like, “Uh, I don’t really want to tell them where I work. That doesn’t feel super good.” Fear of judgment and all that. I’m making plans to hang out with one of my friends - we’re going to go somewhere, I think shopping at a clothing store. But I tell them, “Okay, I’ll be back.” I leave the party and the scene totally changes. I’m in a house that I’ve never seen before, but it's a house that’s owned by my kumu hula from when I was a hula dancer in Hawaii. The kumu hula was incredibly emotionally abusive and not kind to me. She was probably doing her best. I’m in her house. That was my hanai family, too, when I was in the islands, so I spent a lot of time at their house - way more time at their house than my house in my teenage years. So, I’m at her house, which I don’t recognize, it looks different. Her husband, Uncle Jay, is there - he was also my kumu and hanai family. They’re talking to me about planning how they’re going to remodel parts of their house and how it’s going to cost them money, but they finally have money for it, or someone is giving them money or they’re going to earn it. I’m there with kumu and her son who is also in the dream at his younger age (when I knew them, he was 4-8, so he’s one of those ages). They’re showing me how they’re going to do it. They’re really, really friendly - it’s now how I remember it when I left the halau. They are just trying to show me there’s different ways. I’m making plans for the next day and kumu actually says, “Well, come back, be here with me and help me work in the store.” So I guess she owns a clothing store and I have an option of helping her. We finish talking and I go to my room in this house. Another friend calls an...",

We’re at this state park. It’s gorgeous. There’s an open field that’s two football fields long and at least one football field wide. It’s on one side of the road that’s the entrance to the park.

Then on the other side of the road it looks like a school with buildings that look like classrooms but also could be places or cabins where you can pay a fee and stay. I see a playground and a cafeteria or place you can eat where they sell the shitty food you’d find in parks - ice cream cones and corn dogs. There’s another building on the left hand side of the road with the big open field or meadow. The building is on the end of the field. The road goes down and stops at this huge wide river. On this side there are rocks or sands that go down into the river like a beach. On the other side are tall, tall cliffs that drop off into the river and it is deep on this side but shallow on my side. The river flows from left to right. This is a familiar river to me. So there’s tons of kids hanging around. I’m there. At first I thought I was a chaperone, but I’m not. There’s tons of other parents who are chaperoning all the kids. I’m providing supplies. I have bags and bags full of clothes for the kids to wear - the same dress for all the girls to wear or the same pair of jeans for everybody to wear. It’s really bizarre. I have a hundred pairs of them in all different sizes, so everybody has a pair. I’m also in charge of setting up and spreading out the food, but also telling people where to sleep. So I’m basically providing all of the basics for people and organizing it. It feels very much like I’m providing the most efficient way for eve...",

    "Dream": "I am with my friend, Aila, who is Native American and also keeps incorporating parts of my kumu hula teacher from when I was a teenager. As Aila, she is very reverent and has a lot of knowledge. She is bringing a lot of spiritual knowledge and reverence to my dream. As my kumu hula, I feel uneasy around her because she was very emotionally abusive towards me and oppressive of who I was. So I’m going back and forth through a lot of feelings in this dream. Aila is trying to organize a ritual and gathering. She’s trying to gather the people to do ritual. She’s also trying to gather the people in protest. The gathering is happening on a train. We are all getting on this train. The train has a destination, but I’m not sure where. There are men and women. We are gathering in a town and we’re trying to gather because the powers that be - those in charge of the town - are actively trying to suppress us, suppress our rights. I just have the sense of them being the bad guy - and it’s men. We’re all on this train and there are police officers who are trying to interfere and interrupt. Aila’s kids are with her. Mine are not, but I know where they are. Along with the other townspeople, there are also a bunch of younger men who are teenagers or early twenties. We’re on the train and gathering for the ritual, but it’s taking a really long time to start. As I watch, the younger men get off the train. They are not there to support. Their excuse is that they have to go to their practices for their organized sports, whatever that is. I’m watching and I see Aila’s partner Austin who is this very tall cowboy with the boots, the hat, the buckle. He gets off the train to go rather these younger men who are basically deserting. They are deserting their wives, girlfriends, mothers and even fathers - the older grey beards - who are on the train. Aila is still preparing for ritual for all of us to take part in. But Austin leaves to go get these younger men. I leave because I realize my kids a...",

    "Dream": "There’s one part where I’m nursing a baby. I think it’s mine. My breasts are engorged as if I haven’t nursed in a while and the milk is coming out so fast, it’s almost choking the baby. Then I’m with my parents. I’m outside on a street. There’s a curb and a bunch of stand up paddle boards stacked. There’s a bunch of water coming down the street. It’s flooding again. These stand up paddle boards are stacked outside of a store and they’re starting to float off. These boards are a product that once you use them for their initial use, they turn into something else, then turn into something else again. I think it’s quite clever that the people who own this store have managed to figure out how to make items with multiple purposes. So the stand up board changes into a tank for a toilet, which is super efficient and only needs very little water and one flush, then also turns into an indoor house plant or a decoration. I am getting the sense that the products this store is putting out are amazing because each product is 3 different products within one. I’m standing in this street that’s flooded, trying to restack the boards, because I think it’s important for people to get on board with a shop and people who can figure out how to be so efficient and not waste materials and provide the basics of what we need because a stand up paddle board seems like a good idea when the streets are flooding. Then, the dream shifts. There’s a lawn. I’m standing on the side. There are a bunch of people mingling on the lawn - mostly white people. But there’s a Japanese family - mother, father, son. They’re a little bit away from the rest of the crowd and it looks and feels like it's a bit awkward and they aren’t being welcomed into the crowd. But they’re making do because they’re talking with each other. I see the father pick up a pinecone to toss at the son, for him to hit with a bat or catch, like baseball. The dad is in a suit. Everyone on this lawn is very well dressed. All of a sudden, the...",

    "Dream": "The felt sense of this dream is sticking with me - a panic from the coronavirus. I’m in my home, but it doesn’t look like the one I grew up in. It’s warm out, like Spring. The ocean is around in the background - I can hear it. My parents are there along with a dad and two sons who I grew up with. This dad was my dad’s business partner when my dad opened a restaurant. He was a chef and a referee for soccer. I’ve organized a talk because they’re trying to take away our rights. It’s a big community. What’s most striking is this place we’re having the talk is this open lawn - a communal area with grass, trees and shrubs - pink camellia blossoms - and white picket fences everywhere and white folding chairs where we are all sitting. I can feel how everyone needs to sit down and listen to this. I have an agenda and really wanting people to listen to this talk that’s happening, which I feel like I was a part of putting it together. My mom and dad are there and I have this feeling that I have the talk for them to listen to because I want them to grasp a point. I’m upset about something. The talk starts. Coronavirus is happening in the dream. We’re afraid we’re all going to be sick, but we’re wearing our masks, but sitting way too close to each other. People are complaining about not having their freedoms and liberties. The talk is going according to an agenda and people are wanting to say, “enough with this social distancing, isolating and taking away our rights.” But then Bob and his two sons come along with a bunch of other men and boys. They’ve all had the coronavirus and their mothers and wives have died. They’re up in front of us and trying to tell us what it’s like to have this and how devastating it is. Bob is saying that even though he and Sarah were divorced, Sarah came back from a trip to the UK with her partner and didn’t know she was sick. She was cleaning silverware at her job at the hotel before she came down with it and she and her partner died. Of course ever...",

    "Dream": "Two parts to this dream: In the first one, I am with a man, but I’m not entirely sure who it is - it could be my ex, it could be another friend of mine, Josh. He’s very protective. I’m lying down on my back. I can’t tell where I am. There’s a mother ferret and six of her babies lying on my stomach. The babies are little and I’m protecting them. The mother is very content and happy to lie there with me and have me guard them. So I’m lying still. The babies are slowly growing - I’m watching them grow and am being very protective. The man with me is also being protective. I’m not exactly sure where I am - it seems to be outside on the grass. All of these members from my old CrossFit gym and other CrossFit gyms show up. They really want a workout, but it’s the time of coronavirus, people can’t really gather and the gyms are all closed. But all of these people are close to each other - definitely not 6 feet away. They’re gathered around me and I’m definitely still vulnerable because I’m laying on the ground with all of these ferret babies on my tummy. These CrossFit people want a workout and music. I have my iPhone with a playlist that I can play. But I’m telling them: “My playlists are for pole classes. It’s not your normal CrossFit playlist.” They don’t care. They’re adamant that they get a workout. So, it’s either the man I’m with or me telling them to run an obstacle course. It’s kind of like a free for all on this obstacle course. Somebody is trying to win and there aren’t any rules, so people holding other people back and stuff like that happening. But I say, “Okay, the winners get some of these ferrets.” During this whole time, the ferrets are getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Two of them get to be adult size. I put a collar and leash on them and give them away. Along with this man, there are a couple of other people around me - I can’t tell if it’s my kids or somebody else’s kids. So I give those two ferrets to these children. They go off with them. So there ...",

    "Dream": "I’m with my kids. They’re going on a trip. They’re going on a huge boat. The boat is in the harbor and there are icebergs all around. So, clearly we are someplace very far north. My daughter is getting ready. She’s doing that teenager thing where she doesn’t really want me around to help or anything. She’s got it, like, “I’ve got it Mom, I don’t need your help.” My son is clearly very excited. I’ve helped him pack everything. I’m trying to get a lunch packed for him. I have this container and I’ve made beautiful fajitas or something delicious looking and smelling. I’ve made it for him. I’m trying to put the lid on and for whatever reason, the container has bowed somehow. Everything is running into itself. Now the lid is a little bit tight and a little bit smaller. I’m trying so hard to get this lid on the lunch so he can have food while he’s on this trip. He’s in line. There’s this long line of kids of all ages that are going to get on the boat. There are teachers all around as chaperones and other parents. There are sections, too - a section of the line with kids who paid for lunch and they have a lunch waiting for them, and a section of kids who don’t have that. My son is in the latter section because I have his lunch for him. I’m really struggling to get the lid on this thing. I have a sense of panic that I’m not going to have this ready for him by the time it’s time for him to get on the ship. So I run down to the place where they have the lunch pre-prepared for the kids. Some of the teachers are standing right there and I ask them to help me. I add some food from the prepaid lunches because I know my son eats a ton. The principal of the school says, “Hey, that’s $30 for that.” I say, “No it’s not. I'm adding just a few things. He already has his lunch and I’m not paying $30 for that. Just help me get the lid on this thing.” We finally get the lid on it and I go back and hand it to him. I’m worried because I think it’s just a mess now. His lunch is just a mess o...",

    "Dream": "There are a couple parts to this dream. The dreams go into deeper dreams where I’m a little bit less lucid and then I move towards more lucid, or I’m more awake. The deeper part of this dream is me on an airplane. It’s showing up in flashes. There’s one part where I’m in an airport. I’m looking at the arrival and departure boards to find my flight and the gate. There are people bustling all around me. There are gross fluorescent lights everywhere. Shops, too. It’s busy - no social distance is happening, so I don’t know if it is this time or another because everyone is close. No masks. It’s normal. Then I go from looking at this board to being in the airplane and in my seat. I’m on the end of the middle row where there are three seats in a row. There’s an aisle and then two more seats and a window. There are people all around me that I’m sorting of chatting with. I’m with a group of others, I think. I have this sense of keeping track of the other people. I’m sitting in my chair. You know how on long flights your shit ends up everywhere - that’s happened. I can’t find my sweater. We’ve landed and it’s time to disembark but I can’t find my sweater. I’ve taken up two seats in this airplane and it seems to be fine because there was no one near me. There is a stewardess or another passenger who has taken offense that I took my sweater off and maybe my shirt off, too, and was just making myself at home. But now we’ve landed and I’m trying to get my stuff so I can get off and go. It takes me a minute because I can’t find all my things. I disembark. I have a sense that the place is very, very different from Earth. It doesn’t feel like an Earth place and the flight attendant that was talking to me didn’t look quite human. So, there’s this sense that I’m in another realm. I have a sense of agitation, too, because that group I was with is off doing their thing. It took me time to find all my stuff and I feel a little left behind and I don’t want to be because I don’t know where...",

    "Dream": "I’m in a house. It’s very cluttered. One of my brothers is with me. All of a sudden there’s a bunch of tiny little black bugs swarming. They all hatched at once and they’re the size of a freckle. They are everywhere and jumping on me and him. We’re both like, eww get them off. I’m trying to brush them off with a little broom, then trying to suck them up with a vacuum. I'm kind of giving it up as a bad job and thinking I just need to get out of the house. We hear this little squeaking. There’s a rat in a bunch of white paper towels in the shape of a body cast. It’s essentially the same shape as the rat. You can hear the rat inside. Its legs are not in the cast. It’s running towards me and my brother. My brother scoops it up. I get mad and say, “No, no. Give me that rat. That’s our friend. That’s who’s going to help us get out of this mess of tiny little black bugs. We need that rat. That rat loves us and we love it.” As I’m saying this, the cast on the rat is getting looser and looser. There’s more space between the rat and the cast. While I’m looking at this rat, part of me is like, “eww, it’s a rat,” and another part of me is like, “well, if I squint, maybe it will look more like a cat. That will be more acceptable.” It’s clear that this rat very much loves us. I can feel myself trying to love it back, but it’s a rat and it’s so hard. Then the scene changes. Now I’m in a home. The part of the home I’m in is like a tower. It has windows on three or four sides. It’s a square room with a round table in the center. It’s not really big - maybe 10 or 12 feet across in all directions. One side of the room does open up into the rest of the house and is bigger. There is sunshine streaming in through the windows, blue sky and white puffy clouds. It’s gorgeous. I’m having a conversation with my ex father in law who says he’s either moving to Hawaii or is already living in Hawaii. In this conversation, I feel like he’s not giving me a lot of choice in the matter. It feels frus...",

I think there’s some sort of event happening - maybe a fair or festival or something. We’re a part of that. She’s invited a bunch of people I don't really know. She’s hosting. I’m there observing and being moral support for her. The people who show up are all black men and women. I don’t recognize any of them except for two of them. King Noire shows up again and he is with his wife, Jet Setting Jasmine. They are together and with a bunch of other black people. They’re all talking about how we live in a culture of white supremacy and colonialism. There are also some people of color, so it’s not all black people. They are sitting at a picnic table sharing a meal together. There’s food and that seems to be an important piece in this dream. I’m hungry and I want to sit down and eat, but I have this very distinct feeling that I’m not welcome. I just want to listen in and support what they’re saying and learn from them. I think I’m really not welcome here. I don’t know if these are people who would want to break bread with me and share a meal with me. So I’m standing a little far away but still trying to listen. It’s getting heated. They’re getting very annoyed and pissed off about the different aspects of running a business in our society and also just walking down the street in our society. I’m feeling all of these emotions. I’m pissed that that’s their reality and mine. I’m pissed that I feel like there’s not a whole lot I can do to help change the situation so that it’s more equal and fair for everyone. I’m also aware that I can go over there and insert myself, but that would just be more of the same oppression and white privilege. So I am at a loss at what to do, besides listen. I’m watching interactions and watching people coming and going from this table. They’re sort of wrapping everything up. I can see they’re packing up and ready t...",

I’ve just arrived and I’m talking to the manager and she is giving me the rundown of all the things that need to be done today. She says, “Here’s your coat.” There’s an extra coat for me to wear because it’s cold in the freezer and she’s like, “Here’s some music you can listen to.” That’s awesome. I get ready to get all my stuff and go. I’m not sure if we’re in the breakroom when she’s giving me all this stuff. I walk out of that place. All of a sudden I have to get to the cooler to grab all the stuff out of the cooler to stock it. I’m in this gigantic huge grand ballroom. It’s like a maze. There are areas I’m trying to get through. A gala is happening. There’s a huge party. I have to go get the frozen or dairy foods for the party. I have to pull it out, so now I’m catering. It’s being put on by my brothers or a family member, maybe my mom. My mom actually does put on events in real life. So I’m trying to make my way to the cooler. It’s packed. It’s either so packed I can't move or I’m trying to obey the 6 feet distance rule and I’m having a hard time trying to get through the crowd and to the cooler. I have this cart - the carts we use in the back to load up our stuff. I’m trying to make my way, but then I hear the M.C. go: “And now, for our special guest, Arnold Schwarzenegger.” Sure enough, I look towards this doorway where people are coming in and out of. By the way, this is happening in a grand ballroom and there’s also a lawn and patio where this event is also happening. It’s a very big event. In the ballroom, the ceilings are so high I can’t even see the ceiling. The doorways are so tall, as you would see in a ballroom, that it takes a lot of effort just to open one door because the doors are so big and heavy. So these doors are open. The M.C. has announced Arnold Schwarzenegger and he walks through. What strikes me is the couple that walks before him, I think is my mom and dad, bu...",

The parcels are huge and the houses are huge and there’s a lot of space between all of them. The hills are green and rolling. There’s a community center that we’re heading to. I get to this community center and home owners are coming and going. There are tables and chairs in one area and tv’s on the wall. Another area is like a nurse’s office. People are having their temperatures taken and getting shots. I think maybe they’re quarantining for coronavirus or giving vaccines. I’m not sure, but something like that is happening. I’m here. I get dropped off in this community center or clubhouse that the HOA owns. I’m watching people come and go - mostly white men. My ex father in law and ex show up. We have some interactions. I think I owe him some money and he wants the money from me. I don’t think I have everything I owe him, but I give him some. I’m reminding him we’re on a payment schedule and he’ll just have to wait for the rest. This part of the dream feels uncomfortable. I’m really not excited to see him or my ex. I don’t know what my ex wants. He’s just kind of there lurking. I’m really wanting to get away from both of them. They leave with some sort of promise from me that I’ll continue making my payments. I’m going from table to table in the clubhouse. I’m bored. I don’t know why I’m waiting or why I’m still there. For some reason I have to stay because I’m in quarantine of some sorts. There’s a nurse that comes in and gets me. I go into her office. I’m sitting on one of those benches with the paper on it. She’s taking my temperature and drawing my blood. She’s very friendly and I actually feel comfortable with her.

I’m not so stoked about it because we are headed to the pole studio where I’m going to practice. I’m not sure if he was going to work out or practice. It is a pole studio/gym so there is a place for him to go workout. It’s important that he works out and trains because there’s something he’s training for. I am training, too. We get to the pole studio. Unlike the pole studio I practice at, which is light and bright, this studio is pretty dark. The poles are so tall that the tops disappear into darkness. It’s almost like the studio is as big as an amphitheatre. I have a nagging feeling. There are other people training, I don’t know who they are, but they’re all women. We get there and I realize this pole studio and workout facility is owned by Wendy. Wendy is a woman I had a crazy emotionally abusive relationship with and she is now an ex-friend of mine. Going to a place she owns is filling me with dread. The reason we were heading that way is because of quarantine, so she wasn’t there. She was also pregnant and out of the picture, so it was safe for me to go there. Now she’s no longer pregnant and quarantine is over and she shows up and starts being a total tyrant. She hasn’t seen me though, so I hide. I lay on the ground and the other women - some are younger, maybe 12 or so - all sit on top of me and do a dance. They’re like the goddess with lots of arms. They do one of those dances where each arm goes in succession. They’re sitting on me so you can’t see my body at all - I’m covered and hidden. Somehow Wendy sees me anyway. She makes them stand up and get off me so she can see me. She just starts yelling at me - “Get on the pole! Do the moves!” I can’t. I’m tired and I haven’t done pole in a long time, so I don’t have the strength I usually have. This is really hard and I’m feeling attacked without resources to defend myself, just out o...",

We walk into what looks like a sound studio or stage where they film shows. The game is you answer a bunch of questions. You read or watch a little video clip and then you answer questions about it.

I’m looking at myself and my focus is on things like social justice and astrology, but we’re going to do this trivia type thing and it’s all shit I don’t know. The crowd is all white people who, for lack of a better term, look like white trash that watches Ricki Lake. This is my impression. Sure enough, all of the questions are about shit I know nothing about. In my perspective, these questions are really dumb. We’ve answered 5 or 6 questions and I’ve gotten all of them wrong or I haven’t answered them at all because I didn’t know the answer. I’m winning $0. The crowd is booing me and can’t believe I don’t know the answers to any of these things. I’m going like, “Well, this is shit I don’t care about, so of course I don’t know the answers.” All of this stuff is really important to them and the answers to the questions are really easy for them. I’m completely clueless. Their judgment and my judgment are super real. My son is looking at me like, “Mom, this is not fun.” I’m like, “Yeah, this is not fun at all.” I’m wanting to leave because I honestly don’t know any of the answers for any of this and it is not a comfortable situation being jeered at and teased and not winning any prizes.",

They’re all wearing some version of a blue knit sweater. They are all from the same school so this is a uniform but they’ve each made it their own. They’re European or Swedish by nationality, but ethnicity ranges with Asian girls and black girls. They’re all female-bodied and from this one school. They’re sitting in rows in desks and I’m facing them, looking at them. There’s a big green screen behind them. To their right is a male teacher/interviewer. He is asking them these trivia quotations and they’re answering. But he’s a little bit off. Every once in a while he says something that’s super off-color or super sexist or just super objectifying. At one point I hear him saying, “And don’t they all have glorious tits?” I’m like, “What the fuck did he just say?” He says that kind of stuff, but the girls, instead of taking offense, they just own it and make it their own - not in the giggling way and giving away of power, but in a “oh so you noticed, idiot, good.” It’s a very interesting dynamic. But they’re still young. I can feel they’re young and they don’t know everything because they haven’t experienced everything. It’s just so strange. This is all being televised and people are watching. At some point, my focus shifts from these young ladies to the show host. He kind of beckons me over. He wants me to look at the green screen. So I get close to him and say, “Okay, what do you want?” He says, “Look really carefully at this screen.” On the green screen is a map of the world. He says, “They’re only showing you part of it.” As he says that, suddenly all these spots on the green screen that are showing the globe burst into flames - not physical flames, but a simulation of flames that are all over the world. He says, “They’re not showing you everything. The world is on fire in so many more ways and places ...",

    "Dream": "It’s dark or nighttime. There are a bunch of us, all young, maybe teenagers or early twenties. The only person I recognize is my friend, Nani from high school. We’re all being trained to fly airplanes. It’s wartime. These are the kind of planes you see from old photos - the original planes that are all open with no cockpit and only room for one person. The airplanes are all lined up and we’re all lined up getting into our airplanes. I’m getting into my airplane and am wearing shorts - not enough clothes. So I suddenly think I should get some more clothes on. I have some because we are all packed and ready to go. I get some of the clothes out and put them on. I get in the airplane. We’re learning how to fly and have never taken a plane up before. It’s time to go fly these planes now. I’m a little panicked because I don’t feel like I know how to really fly the plane yet. But we go. The airplanes in front of me each start to take off. Then I take off. I’m flying okay. We’re all supposed to meet someplace before we head off to our attack. As I’m flying the plane, my heart is pounding because I don’t feel I have this down. I fly over this school. It’s a college - an old college with buildings with spires and ivy covering the brick walls. I’m flying over and around and I am trying to catch up with the group. I’m having a hard time flying the plane and end up going in circles around this college. I do end up landing the plane on a rooftop. It’s still dark - nighttime. I land the plane and get out on the roof. I climb down the wall and am looking in the windows of the building. There are kids inside. I climb down like I’m going to do some reconnaissance. The whole time I’m panicking that I’m not with the rest of the planes. I’m not really sure what it is I’m doing now, why I’m there or what I’m looking for. I am looking for something, though. There are tall trees on this campus. Then the dream switches and I’m wandering around a downtown I don’t recognize in real life. I se...",

    "Dream": "I’m visiting my friend Emma - she’s a psychic, an intuitive. We are sitting down having a conversation but I can’t remember what the conversation is about. The scene changes to this huge outdoor party. It’s all of these schools and students who are graduating. My high school classmates are there. My parents are there, too. We’re at a pool. It’s like the pools at the Hilton Hawaiian - super long and winding with different sections. I am with my parents. They’re here to celebrate - maybe me...but I don’t know who exactly is graduating. I just know that it’s a huge party outdoors at this poolside. We’re riding on little rafts through the pool area. There are famous people who we want to meet. I don’t recognize them and don’t know who they are in this realm, but in the dream they are famous people. I feel like I’ve met them already and had conversations with them. They seemed pretty cool and humble. I wasn’t extremely starstruck or anything. When I meet them in the dream, everything is really chill and there’s no weirdness about them being stars. In other words, there’s no hierarchy. Then my parents show up and my friends show up and are like, “Yeah, we’re going to meet these people!” So we get on this little raft that takes us from one side of the pool to the other, so we’ve crossed some sort of threshold. The famous people are at this one table. My parents are like, “Come here, we’re going to sit here.” We all (me, my parents and some of my classmates) begin to squeeze in close around these famous people. I’m feeling like this is so awkward. My attention is on my friends, siblings and my parents and I’m talking to them instead of the famous people. I don’t want to be fawning over them - it feels gross. Then we’re all sitting at this table. Somebody starts to announce awards and whatnot. The people who are lined up across the pool on the other side are cheering and we’re cheering. There’s a lot of celebrating happening. The party disperses. For whatever reason, I haven...",

    "Dream": "This dream starts with Dana and I. We’re together and learning about anti-racism. We’re learning from King Noire and his wife, Jet Setting Jasmine. We’re all at a movie theater. They want us to watch a movie as part of our anti-racism education. Their son Majesty is with them. He’s two. Jasmine is breastfeeding him and we’re all watching. I’m uncomfortable. I’m feeling unsure and I don't know what we’re going to watch. These two people are so solid in who they are, what they know and how they show up in the world. I don’t want to harm them in any way or disrespect them in any way, and I’m white. So I’m nervous. We’re watching the movie and Jasmine is nursing the baby. The movie is over and Jasmine gives me Majesty to hold. I'm like, “What do I do with Majesty?! I’m not nursing and I can’t feed him!” I have this feeling that I can’t provide for him or nourish him. But I do know how to hold a baby because I have two kiddos. I take him and I’m nervous. We leave the theater and now Dana and I are just with King and Majesty. We’re now at a convention center. There are multiple rooms with different spaces. Each room has a different conference or panel or presenter. Dana goes off because she is going to learn from somebody. I am still with King and still have Majesty. I hand Majesty to King and he drops him. I’m like, “Oh my god, you just dropped the baby!” I go to pick up the baby and Majesty’s whole body is rigid. His back is arching and his mouth is pulled back in a rictus grin. I’m like, “Oh no!” I’m afraid his back has been broken. King is looking at me like, “What are you going to do?” I’m like, “Uh, you just dropped your baby. What am I going to do?” Then I realize Majesty’s body is going into the typical trauma response from rigidity to shaking it out. So if I just hold him while his body does his thing, he’s going to be okay. So I just hold him and let his body do that. When he’s done, I hand him back to King. The scene shifts a little and I walk into an amphithea...",

There’s another building where they eat. I have work to do, too. I’m out there and thinking I’ll do this work with him. He’s really not happy to see me. He’s really pissed off that I’m in his space. I’m pouring moon blood into containers that look like Monday-Friday pill containers. Instead of just seven compartments, there’s a whole sheet of them, so there’s probably 24 compartments, maybe 36. I have three sheets of them. My moon blood is in a jar where I’ve collected it and I’m just pouring it into each of these sheets and trying to make it an even amount in each. There’s a presence of my son, but he’s not actually there. My lover has stopped whatever work he was doing and he’s upset. He’s like, “I told you I needed space. Why are you here? Don’t come out here.” I say, “Well I’m actually here to do work.” He says, “Don’t lie to me. I know you’re here to see me.” I’m feeling hurt and confused. I’m not really sure why I’m out there except I am happy to see him. He leaves the area and takes me with him, but he’s not happy about it. I’m not happy about it now either, because he’s being a bit of a dick. He’s asking me all kinds of questions like, “What are you doing out here? What is your job? Why are you out here? What are your long term goals?” He’s asking all these questions that I don’t have answers for and it feels like an attack. It doesn’t feel kind. Then other stuff happens that I can’t remember. In the last scene, I’m with a client of mine who is getting married. It’s the day of the wedding and I’m there as an officiant. I’m also there to set up the wedding. It’s the second time she’s trying to get married. The first time everything got shut down because of coronavirus. A lot of the supplies we need for getting ready are not there.

    "Dream": "It looks like a post-apocalyptic city where things have been destroyed or burned down. I’m with my friend Emma and her partner. The two of them are showing me around the city. They’re showing me places where statues have been pulled down and things have been destroyed. All the things that have been destroyed are the white male patriarchy tributes to other white males. We’re in a park. The grass is still green - Gaia is doing just fine in the dream. But all things human-made are falling down and in disrepair. I see a lot of steel and metal that’s been pulled down. It’s all crooked and bent and broken in places. She’s telling me, “They don’t see us and they don’t honor us. They don’t care for us and they don’t put us first. That’s why it all has to come down.” Then the dream shifts and I’m with my ex. His girlfriend is with him. She’s a younger blonde woman. I walk up to her and say, “We haven’t met because this idiot has never introduced us. My name is Rose and I’m the mother of those two children over there.” The kids are in this part of the dream, too. We’re in a neighborhood. They’ve moved and they’re showing me their new house. I’m seeing where they live now so I can pick up the kids when it’s my turn. She’s actually quite easy to get along with and there's a good vibe between us. My ex is still annoying. He’s just combative with me. He’s trying to talk to me, but the tone in his voice is so condescending and really forceful. There’s no room for discussion with him. He’s just giving ultimatums. I’m not feeling like listening to that, so I ignore him as usual. I go over to see the kids. The kids are kind of squirrely. My son is happy to see me; my daughter, not so much. They’re both really clear that they want to live with their dad in this house that he and his girlfriend have. The house has swings in the front yard and a waterslide. There are lots of fun things to do here, so of course the kids are going to pick that. Then the scene shifts again. I’m in a downto...",

At one point, I’m not paying attention and totally cross the center line and almost nail an oncoming car. My mom was freaking out in the passenger seat, as she should. I get back in my lane and we make our first stop at this house of a friend of mine and my ex’s relatives. This house is kind of cool. It’s a bunch of millennials and their focus is on social justice. They all share the house. They do lots of things together. Everything is focused on quality conversation and connection and conflict resolution, which when you live with a bunch of roommates is probably a good idea! They really go out of their way to connect. They play games to connect. They welcome us into the house and show us our bedrooms and everything. They invite us to play one of their games. I kind of lose track of my mom at this point. I think she’s there, but I’m not totally sure; she just kind of fades into the background. The young woman who is the person I know has dark curly hair down to her shoulders, Latina, shares a room with another woman who is her girlfriend. There are two or three men that all share a room. One man is gay. There’s only one white man in the entire house. It’s so interesting. I’m noticing all of this. They’re starting to play a game and the game is hard to explain - they are explaining to me a set of rules. There’s an activity for us to do and we all do the activity in our own way. At one point this activity takes us all out of the house. I find myself in a mall then back in the front yard of the house. At one point, there is a little bit of conflict, but I watch as they really calmly and with a lot of emotional intelligence explain their side and listen without judgment. Everyone is speaking with the “I feel” and “I experience” and “When this happened, it made me feel like this” language. Everyone is really supportive of each other and cheering each other on a...",

I’m staying in this house with him, but I’m not sure why. He has other people in the house with him and it’s like he collects orphans and I’m one of the orphans he’s collected. I’m in one of the bedrooms sleeping, zonked out, kind of, but I can see people coming in and out of the bedroom to see me. There’s a cleaning lady that comes in at some point and cleans around me while I’m passed out in the bed. The little man is entertaining other people. It’s very interesting. I don’t know what happens. At some point, the man brings his friend over who is the same height as him. She’s a woman and has a bob cut, her hair is red and short. This little man has grey, shoulder length hair. They act out this skit together, kind of like a TikTok. They act out this skit that I watch. I’m observing all this and the way he treats people who are coming in and out of his house is a little strange and removed. Then the scene changes. I’m with my friend Josh. I'm seeing these gigantic redwood trees. There’s a road next to me on my left and the shoulder is so wide that it looks like a park. There are picnic tables and at one table, people are throwing a birthday party - I’m guessing, but not sure. They’re having a meal together. It’s warm out and reminds me of Hawaii, even though the trees are redwood, they sway like palm trees. I’m hearing the sound of the ocean. It’s a gathering of people coming together to celebrate. It feels nice and pleasant and celebratory. There’s affection with all the people. Cars are whizzing by because it’s still a road. A couple of feet down there is another picnic table and another group of people celebrating, so it’s like there are all these pods of celebrations happening. Then the dream switches. I’m showing Josh how to get to this one valley where there are waterfalls and pools of water. I’ve actuall...",

We’re walking through the town with our tokens so we can take part in the events. I’m with my dad and we’re looking at a flyer that says something like: a couple tokens to do this talk with Mexican-Americans to hear their side of the story and get anti-racism training. My dad pays the money, but nothing happens and no one shows up. It’s a little mind boggling. We continue on and go see some other events. At one point, we’re in a car traveling and I’m the driver. I don’t know if I should be driving because I feel under the influence of something, not alcohol. I’ve got some friends in the back and maybe a sibling or two. At one part I drive over a bridge. The bridge is made of wood and it’s really, really high. I think there is water beneath the bridge. As I’m driving over it I think I should not be driving and I’m not safe to drive. We get over the bridge and I’m sweating because it’s freaking me out. We get to a downtown area where the buildings are close, the streets are narrow, and there are a lot of pedestrians. I’m very anxious to get the car parked back at the house becuase I’m scared I’m going to kill someone or everyone in the car. I still don’t know what I’m on or why I have this anxiety around driving. Eventually we do get back to the house. I get out of the car. A bunch of people go inside. I go inside for a second. The house is interesting - it’s a very Victorian era looking house on the outside and inside. It’s got a lot of space - the ceilings are tall, which kind of contradicts the Victorian era architecture because the houses are usually kind of small on the inside. I’m inside for a little bit. I go to the backyard and the area where the Mexican-American anti-racism talk was supposed to happen is actually happening in the backyard. The landscape changes from town to lush woodland. The sign or billboard that ann...",

We walk into this bar and it’s a two-story high bar and I can see a balcony where I can see the second story. It’s wood paneling, so the bar is dark and very masculine. There are deer heads on the wall and the tables are round and wooden. It kind of reminds me of a saloon, like a cliche Western. We walk up to the corner of the bar so my brother can order his drink. I turn around and see three guys who I haven't seen in a long time. One of the guys is a classmate of mine and also grew up on the same street as me. I haven’t seen him since we graduated. I'm like, “Oh my god! Hi! How are you?!” He’s really tall, taller than me and I’m 5’10” so he’s 6’4” or 6’5” so I’m definitely looking up at him. There’s also my friend Johnny who I grew up with in the same neighborhood, though we didn’t go to school together. I knew him the whole time growing up. There’s one other person, maybe Ikaika, another classmate who I’ve known since second grade. They come and stand behind me. They’re ordering drinks over my shoulder to the bartender. Initially I'm like, “Oh my gosh, hi, it’s so good to see you all!” Then they’re like, “Hey!” My former high school classmate starts asking me these condescending questions like: “How are you and what are you doing in your life? What have you accomplished?” I’m like, Whoa! This took a turn that I wasn’t expecting. They’re standing over me so I’m definitely feeling attacked and defensive. I don’t know if I get up on a chair or suddenly have super powers, so I can hover above them. But I get above them, the bartender and my brother and I’m like, “And what are you all doing with your life? Are you guys looking at your misogynistic beliefs and your sexist behaviors? What are you doing to undo the patriarchy and fight for social justice? How are you looking at your biases and your beliefs?” I’m asking specifically about...",

He’s wearing a light blue robe or shirt. He starts to move his hands like an air bender. I start to fall asleep like the REM healing sleep and there are images coming to mind. I tell myself to remember these images so I can remember them later. Then I go into the deep healing sleep. He’s still doing the airbender motion in front of my body. I’m lying on my right side the whole time, almost in the fetal position. He’s working at chest level - heart and solar plexus energy centers. I have a sense that I’m asleep for a while. As I come out, my brain kicks in again and tells me to remember the healing images. As I wake up, the healer says: “Tend to your masculine energy child. Look up Libra moon. That’s what you need for healing.” I did a deep healing breath as he finished his hand motions - in both my sleep in my dream and my sleep in real life. I woke up in that position - lying on my right side. I had a sense he was removing an energetic entanglement.",

I’m having a hard time finding a wall to put it against or just a spot to have it. It needs a plug and I can’t find a plug. I’m brainstorming and talking out loud with myself and with her to try and get this piano put someplace. But it’s her house, so I have this feeling of reservation because I need to get her permission. It feels a bit awkward because I don’t think she needs the piano. She’s also my boss and I’m fucking around with this piano thing, but there is work I need to be doing, so that feels a bit odd. It’s also quarantine time like now, but more apocalyptic feeling. My attention moves on from the piano and the headlines are pretty dire with deaths and whatnot. I’m also reading the astrology and getting the astrology report - it was basically telling me to buckle up because there’s more tension and destruction coming. We’ve already had a lot, but there’s more based on the planetary alignments. For whatever reason, it’s time for me to leave the house. I head out and am walking down the side of the road. I don’t know if I have my mask on or if I’m carrying it with me. The skies are dark and ominous. There are cars going by and I’m trying to avoid them. It’s strange, it’s like I’m trying to avoid people all together. The road is paved, but either side of the road are grassy fields without a lot of buildings or anything. In the distance I can see a stand of trees, way far down the way. All of a sudden there's a group of younger people also on the side of the road. I’m trying to keep distance from them for whatever reason - I don’t know if it’s quarantine rules or what. I can hear what is going on. They’re all talking and being talked to by a scout leader or something. The scout leader is trying to prepare them for stuff. I’m trying to mind my own business and read the astrology and whatnot. They are teenagers, 16-18 years old. The scout leader is warning ...",

All kinds of people are there - all races, all colors, all genders and non-genders - the whole human family. I’m not sure what we’re watching or participating in - not sure if it’s a show or convention or speeches or sporting event. But something is happening down in the center of the arena.

To my right two rows down is a black family - I see a woman and a man. I fall asleep at some point. I wake up suddenly because there is a lot of noise and it has gotten loud in my section. I startle awake. I’m trying to figure out what's going on. The black woman two rows in front of me is talking about the white women that had been over to my left. Apparently they said something totally racist and obnoxious, but I missed it because I had been asleep. She’s talking to the other white people in the crowd: “When are y’all going to say something?!” She’s mad; she’s pissed. I’m trying to catch up on what’s happened and hear what she’s saying, but my brain is foggy and muggy. I missed the whole event and my window to say something to those other white women who were being rude. All I can feel is the pain of all the balck people around me of being treated as not human. It’s making me mad. I’m really upset and I’m also really conscious that my anger and sadness for them is not really appropriate to express because I fell asleep and I don’t know what’s really going on, and I’m white and they see me as the enemy. This is making me want to cry to know that my empathy and compassion would be rejected. I also feel anger at the white women that seemed so ignorant and uncaring in their ways. There’s a shift in the dream. Now this event suddenly makes sense. This is a showcase of cultures. There was black culture in the hundred ...",

I walk through the cafe because I’m meeting people there. Then I go to leave the cafe and get my shoes. I walk through this door and bend down to grab my slippers. There are four pairs of slippers. One of my friends who I’m there to meet - this friend is switching between my friend Beth and a classmate from high school - her face keeps changing. As I bend down to pick up my slippers, she slams the door open onto my head. I don’t know if she did it on purpose or not. My reaction is that she did it on purpose, because I stand up and slam the door back on her. I’m pissed that she has hurt me like this because it was so unexpected and triggered my trauma response which is, “if you hit me, I’m going to hit you back harder.” I do it. Then I’m like, “Oh god!” I still can’t tell whether she did it on purpose or not because she’s very shocked that I slammed the door back on her. But she also has a malicious look in her eye like she got me to do what she wanted me to do, which was to hurt her. Then she goes and tells everyone that I just slammed the door on her. I’m feeling all kinds of shame about it. I walk back into the cafe with the owner who is my friend in the dream realm. I’m trying to explain myself, but I can just feel that I should not have slammed the door on her and hurt her like that. Any words coming out of my mouth sound like a terrible excuse. The cafe itself is very bright and airy. There is a lot of white, lots of big windows. Everyone is hustling and bustling and all the servers are pretty quick. You can hear the clink of glasses and china. There are pastries coming out and coffee being served. So the space itself is pretty bright, but me coming in to say I just did this thing feels very shadowy in comparison. The...",

    "Dream": "I’m with a bunch of people I don’t know. We’re younger, maybe early twenties. We’re gathered from all parts of the globe. It is in the time of coronavirus because everyone has to wear masks. There are people I recognize - a guy I used to work with from the grocery store and a few others. We are all getting some kind of training. There’s a woman who puts off some sketchy evil vibes. She is talking with us. We are doing some sort of evaluation but also trained or taught about how to use our superpowers. She’s like, “For all of us to do what we need to do, there are certain boundaries or lines that will be crossed.” I’m thinking, “I don’t think I signed up to be a bad guy.” I’m listening to her talk. She has a little pet animal in her lap. We’re all sitting at a long, tired dining room table. She’s down below me and there’s maybe eight or twelve students on either side of her down below. I’m on the other side of the table which is higher than hers. I’m looking down and watching. There are maybe only four or five of us on this side of the table. This little pet in her lap looks like Stitch from “Lilo and Stitch.” She’s talking to it and petting it while she’s talking to us. I get the sense that it has special powers and it is evaluating us and telling her in her ear which one of us will be good candidates for something. I watch her get up and walk around the table with it. It tells her specific things. It points at an Arab student next to me and shakes its head no. She looks at him and tells him to leave because I guess he doesn’t have the power that he needs to have to do the things she wants us to do. So he grabs his extra masks. He had tried to hand me a mask earlier like I didn’t have one, but I said, “Thanks for the extra one, but I am actually wearing one right now.” He leaves. She holds the animal near me. In my head or somebody drops this knowledge that the animal tells her we each can have an animal and it corresponds to an emotional superpower. I suddenly unde...",

    "Dream": "My dream was like a full on sci-fi movie starring Ryan Renolds. It starts out with us in outer space and there are aliens who are trying to bomb the earth or blow up the entire universe. The drama is high. Everyone is in panic and fight or flight mode. I think I’m on a ship. We’re trying to figure out how to stop the aliens. Ryan Renolds is trying to come up with a plan. There are a ton of people and I don’t know any of them. They are the movie extras. I don’t think I see the aliens, I just see their ships through a spaceship window. The plan includes getting ahold of these two units that will blow something up - very typical movie bullshit. I’m on the ship. There are a couple ships in the fleet. All of the ships fly at superspeed. They’re flying through the planets in our solar system, so we’re whizzing by Mars and Venus, then you see Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune. I think the goal is to get to Jupiter or Saturn and blow up one of them. So, this is the scene. Then just like in the movies, the movie cuts away to Earth because we’re all trying to save Earth. The sky on Earth is a blood red - it looks like how the sky looked when all the smoke was around. I’m on the street suddenly and Ryan Renolds is with me. I don’t know if I’m actually interacting with him or not. It’s almost like I’m silently following him at first. I guess I’m the girlfriend character in the movie and he’s talking with me. We’re on the streets of Earth and I look up and see the sky is red. I keep seeing all these white parachutes falling - it’s the people who were on the spaceships. They’re coming home so they can say goodbye to their loved ones. They’re all ejecting out of space and coming down to Earth for one last goodbye to all the people they love. In the meantime, Ryan is still trying to figure out how to stop the aliens. They’re trying to find the hole in their plans or where their weak spot is. There’s a scene with the parachutes falling and I’m listening to him talk and figure something ou...",

I don't know what we’re doing in the house. There’s something we’re supposed to be doing as a group. I end up leaving the house. I go somewhere else. The house is in a city. I don’t know where I go, but I find myself trying to make my way back to the house but then driving a car. My dad is in the car and we’re going into the city through the backway to avoid the traffic and major roads. He’s in the passenger seat and asking me if I know where I’m going. I’m like, “Yeah dad, thanks, just be quiet and follow along. Don’t worry, we’ll make it to our conference.” But the GPS navigates me back to the house I had been at. This house had a lot next door to it with a rundown house and a bunch of land that was run down. When we get back, the house next door that was run down now is occupied by a cute lesbian couple. They’re bakers. They’ve fixed up the house. The gardens are all fixed up. They have right down the road an off the charts bakery that’s super fantastic. So we get there and my dad’s like, “This isn’t where we’re supposed to be.” I’m like, “Yeah, I know. But the upside of this is this bakery is available to us and we need to stop and get water anyway.” So we go into the bakery. The floors are wood. There’s a section with the bakery case. It’s packed! There are so many people - tourists from all over the place and locals. I go in and we walk up to the counter. I say, “I hear you guys are famous. Do you have grain-free and dairy-free desserts? I can’t eat those other things.” They’re like, “In fact, we do.” So they take me down to the far end of the case and show me the items that I can have. I’m so excited about it. My dad’s excited about it, too. We order the items we can order. But it takes a while for them to get them to us because there are so many people who have ordered and there are so many people in front of us. We ...",

I’ve already done my apprenticeship actually and now I’m coming to learn what she does at her station. She’s in this small tourist town with all four seasons, and it’s Fall now. I’m not exactly sure what she’s there for, but she’s showing me how she does the Work. There are some things I need to know about the job specifically. I’m not sure if she’s there for protection or what. We’re in a house, like an old cabin with walls made of wood. I’m watching what she’s doing. She has this rolling cart that’s got two tiers and a bunch of stuff on it. She’s showing me how to charge up some things. I’m looking out the window and there’s water everywhere, so I think we’re on a lake or something. The town is behind us. I’m watching her hands move. I’m watching each of the steps she’s taking. I go to put my hands near the cart with artifacts. Everything feels really strong. I can feel the energy coming off. She keeps asking things like, “Can you feel that? We’re adding extra protection.” I’m like, “Of course I can feel that. Everything is really strong. This is what I’m trained for.” At one point she interrupts herself and apologizes. She says, “These are my neuroses and I worry about these things. This is what I worry about, but I think you’ll be fine.” I’m like, “Yes, I will be fine. I’ve had the training. I’m strong. I can feel the energy coming off. I can direct and mold and shape it as you’re doing. This is something I know how to do.” Then I maybe leave her to go run an errand or something. The scene changes and I’m outside the house. I’m walking through the town on the streets. I know a car accident is going to happen and then I witness it but keep going because I know the people can handle whatever is happening because it’s not a bad one, it’s just a fender bender t-bone, but everyone was going less than 25mph.

My ex shows up and his parents show up. I get this feeling of, “Oh my god, get the fuck away from me.” His dad is the most prominent person in the dream. He’s scolding me like I’ve done something wrong and I need to go with them somewhere. We get in the car - I don’t know if it’s my car or their car, but it’s a stick shift. I’m driving it backwards, like I’m in reverse the whole time. I’m having a fucking hard time staying on the road the GPS is telling me to go on. I keep driving onto the wrong road. At one point I get in a parking lot and I go around the parking lot three times. His dad is being condescending and telling me I’m going the wrong way. But I’m driving the way he wanted me to drive or the way he was showing me to drive and that’s why I’m having such a hard time. Finally after three or four attempts of trying to get on the right road to get where we were supposed to be going, I’m like, “Fuck it.” I stand up and turn around and sit in the car facing the way I’m used to driving it. Then we start heading towards their hotel room in the city. The kids and I were closer to the beach on the outskirts, but now we’re heading into the city. I don’t want to be with my ex, his dad or his mom. I don’t want to be in this car. I don’t want to be in this city. All of this is so wrong. Now I’m driving facing the right way and I’m following the GPS but it’s taking me weird places. I’ve never driven in this area before. We go through residential areas and I drive on the wrong road but we make it through. Then at some point I’m like “Fuck it, I’m not going to take this car because it’s going wrong places.” Now the GPS is saying, “Okay get out of the car and now you have to go on foot through all these places.” It’s still coronavirus times and there are all these weird things we have to do.

They were working on some kind of project and swimming back and forth across the river. The big part of the dream that stands out is that I was holding a baby and it was someone else’s baby. They handed the baby to me and said, “Feed it.” I looked at them confused because it wasn’t my baby and I had no milk to feed it. Whoever handed it to me, the baby’s mother, did something to me so my breasts were lactating. I remember my breasts hurting. I could feel the feeling of let-down but also the soreness of when you’ve just started breastfeeding or your baby has nursed a little too hard and your nipples are sensitive. I could feel that and the pressure of being engorged. I couldn’t feed the baby fast enough. I kept trying. The baby had a plastic face shield that everyone is wearing these days and it couldn’t get to the milk. I tried to lift the face shield up so it could latch on, but the baby just couldn’t get latched on in the right way. I remember feeling frustrated but also scared for the baby because I couldn’t feed it and wasn’t able to give it what it needed. I also remember the pain of being engorged and not being able to nurse.",

They’re both retired, they don't have jobs, they don’t work. The reason I’m hiring this detective is because I don’t think they’re watching my son very well and I don’t think it’s entirely safe. They’re watching him for me because I’m working and I don’t have time to watch him and I need them to watch him for me while I work to make money. They’re in a pool on vacation or at the place they live. It’s odd that they’re together because they don’t really know each other in real life. The detective watches them and sort of gets involved and is telling them how they’re not doing a good job watching my son. My son is about two or three in this dream. Both of them, my dad and ex-father-in-law, are taken aback at being lectured by this man who’s telling them how to do their job. Neither of them can figure out who has hired this detective. They each think the other has hired him, so they’re trying to point fingers at each other about it. I’m observing this whole thing. I’m on the pool deck somewhere but they don’t see me. I show myself to them to check in on my son. They’re both trying to convince me as to why the other one is not doing a good job. I eventually say, “No, I’m the one who hired the detective to show me that you guys are not doing good. The reason I hired him is because the two of you are neglecting my son a bit and you’re both talking shit about me and the fact that I’m not around to watch my son and it’s because I have to work because no one else is supporting me and you two old white guys have a whole ton of privilege and never had to stay home to watch the kids and don’t know what it’s like to be a single mom and have no idea how hard it is. All I’m asking for is a little bit of help and you two can’t even give me that. I hired a detective to check up on you.” My ex-father-in-law’s eyes start to tear up ...",

There’s a little outcropping of lava that goes out into the ocean and the end of it is where people have done ritual or left offerings to the ocean and it seems to be a very common practice in this place because there are a lot of offerings there. I’m watching these two younger men in their late twenties or early thirties talking to each other in a brotherly way. They’re bashing each other and it’s getting a little bit heated but there’s obviously a bond between them. One of them is saying, “I said the prayer and I put the spell out there and i left the offering out there.” The other brother or whoever it is says, “I keep hearing that you just have to wait. You have to be patient.” I’m watching the waves and the waves are very frothy, where they keep hitting a lot of white water. The two brothers dive in no problem and I see them navigating, they’re not worried about rip tide or getting pulled out or getting smashed on the rocks that are all around. I think they clearly know these waters and this area and they’re navigating this just fine. Then I go somewhere else and I don’t know where. But I come back to this beach. Now the brothers or maybe they’re friends are arguing again. They’re arguing with a white woman with short curly hair cut to her jaw line, blonde. The brothers have darker skin and dark jet black hair. The one who put the spell and offering out at the end of the outcropping has a goatee. She’s kind of haranguing the one who put the offering out there. She’s like, “Why do you even believe in that shit? It’s total bullshit.” He looks at her and is like, “What are you talking about? We know that you’re one of the most powerful psychics in the town.” She’s like, “No I’m not. This is total bullhit. What you’re doing is bullshit. You’re being foolish.“ He asks, “Okay, what did the wizard say?” She stops and drops into a trance and goes, ...",

We’re going to a park where we can camp and there’s also a house and cabins you can rent. We’re celebrating something. It’s very chill. There’s a pond with a slide and a diving platform that are facing each other so there’s literally no room between the slide and the diving platform, so if you were to ride down the slide, you’d end up on the diving platform, or if you wanted to dive off the diving platform, you’d dive right onto the slide. It’s very bizarre and in the very center of the pond which is not even big enough for swimming. There are trees and it’s like a forest. There’s also an open area. We’re there celebrating and I’m actually starting to get concerned because I’m seeing that tons of people are showing up and it’s turning into a crazy mob, like a huge party of college kids. In my mind I'm going, “Uh, coronavirus is up and we’re all going to get coronavirus now, great. This is not okay.” When all the people show up, the pond gets bigger. I’m wading into the water. I’m wearing this one-piece swimsuit and it’s got an eighties vibe because the legs are super high cut and I have a crazy cameltoe going and it’s a shiny burnt orange color. I don’t wear one-piece swimsuits, only when I was on the swim team. My hair is down and I’m standing at the edge of the water pulling some playboy moves. People are watching and I’m getting uncomfortable because I’m there for myself. I came to this thing because it was going to be a small intimate gathering, but now there’s tons of people. There are shenanigans happening everywhere - bottles being broken on the grass, people rocking in their camper vans, loud music playing, people partying at the back of their trucks. It’s crazy. I keep focusing on the slide and diving platform because I want to go down the slide, but it’s too close to the diving platform. Eventually I go in the water and then come out.

I’m showing them how to get over a barrier that looks a lot like the plastic plexiglass barriers that we have up now because of coronavirus, between cashiers and people. The barriers are really tall and kind of remind me of a hockey rink. The panels are skinny and narrow though, attached to a solid unbroken bottom foundation. The plexiglass panels bend a lot because I can pull them down almost in half and climb up over them. We climb over them. I don’t know where we’re going, I’m just showing them how to do this. We come to this lake and I’m having a psychic energy session with a psychic, but I don’t know who she is. It’s actually not just her, it’s a whole council of beings so I’m wondering if this is my own council. I know they do some energetic work, but I have one last question for them. I’m like, “Hey I haven’t bled in a while. What’s going on with that?” I’m thinking it’s menopause or something. The guide, a woman with short blond hair, says, “Oh let me look.” She looks and says, “That’s because you’re pregnant, kitten.” She calls me kitten! I’m like, “Oh god, nope. This isn’t good.” I’m not excited about this. I don’t see the other guides in front of me, they’re kind of like a voice in my head because I’m now back at this lake. It’s dark around me and the water is dark. I’m standing on an island. The people I’m with are constantly shifting and changing. I don’t see who they are and don’t recognize any of them. There’s a guy who looks a little like a Star Wars character, the guy who plays Hans Solo and Leia’s son. He is throwing things into the water.

Interesting enough, the parents are parents of a friend of mine from growing up, so they aren’t his actual parents. Grandma and Grandpa, siblings and spouses are there. So we’re in this place and I feel kind of out of place like I’m not really welcome there because I’m just the girlfriend. This is a very strange feeling. They don’t believe in or agree with anything I’m saying. Whatever input I’ve made, they’re constantly judging and looking at me. At some point I hear the mom tell Josh, “She’s no good for you. Don’t be with that person.” This is crazy. I’m getting this feeling that they’re super rich and I’m not, so I’m not fitting in that way as well. I go out to the backyard. I can see a view of beautiful mountains and I can feel all of that calling me. I want to go out there. But then I get called back to the inside and that’s when I hear the mom talking shit about me. I go down and lay in the bed. I keep coming back to this bed. The dream starts with me in the bed and then I come back to sleep. Josh is with me sometimes and other times he’s not. The second time I leave the bed the house is transformed into a college campus. There are college aged kids with backpacks hurrying all over the place. I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m still feeling really out of place, like I can’t relate to what they’re talking about or with what they’re interested in. I’m not taking any classes. Then I go back to this bed. I’m laying in the bed and look up to my right. There's a huge bird that looks like a cross between a stork and a flamingo with a long neck and long legs. I don’t remember what color it is. It’s standing next to this gigantic mushroom. Then there’s a smaller really colorful bird hopping around on the ground. I’m seeing all of this from the bed. I think Josh is with me this time.

I’m sitting in the corner of the kitchen where the cabinets come together. I’m sitting on the floor. She’s yelling at me. My little brothers are there. They’re little again. My brother that was born right after me is also there, but he looks like he’s maybe just out of his teenage years. So maybe I’m in my early twenties. She’s yelling at me and my two youngest brothers. My other brother and I are going to take the kids on a trip. We’re going to the grocery store. We go to the grocery store in his white Tacoma truck (he doesn’t have one in real life). My brothers are in the car with us. We go to the grocery store and get all of our supplies. Then we go to check out and my brother decides the lines are too long for him and he’s pissed off. So he decides to take the cart full of groceries and somehow get them in the truck that’s now in the store. He drives the truck through these two doors. The regular sliding doors are not an option because there are a ton of people in there and a rent-a-cop. There are these two doors on the side which I don’t think a truck can fit through, but he drives through them anyways. The truck barely makes it through. He heads out into the parking lot which is full of people. I’m pissed at him like, “You just fucking stole groceries! And you almost run over people. We need to go back.” He circles around the huge parking lot. He’s trying to park but we’re on a side of the building with an entire school’s worth of parents and kids. The kids are running around. This is where he decides to park. I’m getting more and more pissed because at any moment the cops are going to come and arrest us for stealing groceries even though I didn’t steal them. I’m also afraid he’s going to hit some of the kids running around this parking lot. The kids are kindergarten up through fifth or eighth grade. He parks in one stall th...",

    "Dream": "I’m on a college campus - it’s not one I’ve ever been on before. There are a lot of college kids. A strange lockdown is happening with very strict rules about which buildings we can be and when and if we can be outside. No one is allowed off the campus for our safety. It’s kind of like pandemic times, but none of us are wearing masks. I’m not sure why we have all these rules. The buildings are strange, a mix of really old and really modern. Part of the buildings are falling apart, but their design is modern. I’m in a gymnasium trying to work out. There are floor to ceiling windows and the ceiling is three to four stories high. There’s glass on this one wall and I’m looking out at an atrium filled with plants and lots of light coming in. This guy I knew from college is there. He was a prick who hated the fact that I became a personal trainer before him and passed all the tests before him and was basically smarter than him. He was a chauvinistic asshole. I found papers that he had written to my boss when I had gotten my boss’ afterwards complaining about me. He was a whiny little entitled bitch! He’s in the dream whining at me. In the dream I’m like, “Nope. Bye.” I was sitting on a stationary bike staring out the windows when he came up to me. He had a client with him and was being passive aggressive and saying shitty things. So I left. I head outdoors. It’s raining and the rain is worrisome because an alarm starts to sound. I’m walking around and see a bunch of college kids hanging out in this fenced area outside connected to their dorm room. They’re basically just parting and there’s music. I see other buildings with classrooms where teaching is happening. So the alarm goes off because of the rain. I head indoors, but then am like, “Oh, I actually need to be outside.” But once I head indoors it’s like a labyrinth and I can’t get out. Everyone else is sheltering and hiding out. I’m walking under and through all these buildings. The buildings keep getting older and ol...",

In the dream, I was sleeping in a house, probably not this house, my daughter and housemate were in the house. I heard a boom and thought it was an earthquake - it was an earth shaking boom. I was half asleep going “oh it’s an earthquake, be calm, you’ll be fine, get my daughter.” Then I open my eyes and realize it was an explosion and there was lava or fire. I don’t know if the earth cracked open or a giant super volcano exploded and there was lava everywhere or if an asteroid had hit the earth. I don’t know what it was, but it wasn’t just an earthquake. There was lava fire red energy everywhere. I was like holy shit! It was rising in my bedroom. I was thinking to myself, whoa this is it, we’re going to die. Then I woke up.",

I’m like, “Oh great, this is it, I guess I’m going to die.” The wave came and it took me under. I expected it to toss me around and I figured I was going to whack on the rocks. But I didn’t. I was just suspended. Then I came back out of it and was fine. I was like, “Huh. But where is my daughter?” I don’t think she was with me at first, but I knew she was there on the beach or something. So I’m looking for my daughter and I can’t find her. I’m freaking out. I’m running around and sobbing and calling for her. I see some teachers from her old school and they don’t look all that concerned. I ask, “Where’s my daughter? Where’s my daughter?!” And they’re like, “Oh, I don't know.” Then I see one of my daughter’s friend’s mom. I ask her and she doesn’t know. Nobody is freaking out. But my daughter is missing and there was just a tidal wave. I’m like, “Oh my god!” and I’m so upset. I finally find her, but I can’t remember where. Her friend is still missing, so I’m trying to find her friend. There were other parts of the dream I can’t remember.",

It was the Mother and there was a baby - a little piece that was connected to it and was the baby. Somehow it got disconnected from its mother and someone threw it into a pool. I was like, “Oh my god, it needs to be with its mother!” So I dove into the pool. I was swimming all over and all around and the pool was fifty or a hundred feet. I was going to the very bottom. I was seeing all kinds of other things. I saw my Bun-bun which is my bunny that was given to me when I was born and I still have it. I was like, “Oh, there’s Bun-bun!” Clearly it was a deep dream of my psyche and what’s down at the bottom and memories of childhood. But I kept looking for the baby piece that needed to be with the mommy piece. At a certain point I was looking underneath chairs and I was having other people help me. I was really worried about this baby that needed to be with its mother, but it wasn’t a real baby.",

There is a mass of people - a huge crowd - like a music concert mosh pit. It feels threatening. A TSA agent shows me a way to the side where it’s not as crowded. She then shows me her forearm with a tattoo of a unicorn. It’s a 3D tattoo and as she moves her arm, the unicorn seems to come alive. Then there is a child with a stuffed animal that is part dog (or something) and part giraffe. Another person has a similar beast. Even though it is a stuffed animal, it moves, makes sounds and eats, but doesn’t poop.",

There are only a few of us, a scattered remain of people who survived. There’s dust in the air, smoke obscuring the sky, and everything is muted with this dust and smoke. She’s guiding us through these physical embodiment exercises to cultivate energy and joy again in our bodies. We have almost forgotten how this feels in our body because we have been so tightly controlled by fear and these other exercises that have kept us under control - emotionally, mentally, physically. I was also there with my best friend from childhood. She also survived.",

My husband, another man, and I unsettle a man that’s been sleeping. We nudge at his shoulders and try to wake him up, interfering with his sleep. He starts to grumble. Then we realize that it’s a really dangerous thing we’ve done - waking him up. He’s now after us with a gun. I run downstairs and move a bench out of the way next to a bed and shimmy under the bed. I’m hiding there and I can see under the bed that it’s dusty with moth balls. I also see one of my son’s winter hats and one of my malas. Then I realize that I’ve forgotten the light and it’s still on. So I start to scooch out to turn off the light. As I do this, my husband comes into the room and says the guy has gone back to sleep, but he’s not fully asleep. He’s levitating with his arms reaching up to the sky, in an interesting dream state, so we’re okay. He’s not going to come after us with his gun. So my husband and I join the other man - the one who helped us wake him up - in the kitchen and I start putting away the dishes. It’s really early morning and dark - the sun has started to rise.",

It’s odd and doesn’t feel right for me to continue teaching. So I wrap up and I don’t even teach savasana. As I’m walking out, the teacher who used to teach this class walks past me and into another room. The chairs are lined up for a film showing and talk. I say hello, but there is a bit of awkwardness as I leave. In the next part of the dream, I see Victoria in her younger self - the one before she was married and became a mother, and before she was focused on her current business. I see her go into a glass house. She sets a fire that turns the glass black and opaque. I go inside hoping she’s still alive. She is passed out on a couch holding a cigarette. I’m amazed she hasn’t burnt up. I pull her onto the deck and try to resuscitate her. I try to call 911 on my cell phone, but then hear music. I look down confused and see I dialed 933. I panic and try to call 911 again, but then think I need to call her partner. She’s still not breathing. Then I wake up.",

He’s really looking forward to this man because he’s a very good kisser. But the man’s body is so distorted - he’s overweight, his face is pock marked with red oozing blisters, his eyes are drooping. He decides to bring his boyfriend who is short and stocky. I’m not happy about the situation but there’s nothing I can do about it. Later in the night, my husband returns from a hotel room. He’s really disappointed because the guy and his boyfriend just fucked each other the whole time and he was like okay, where am I in this whole situation? I asked him if he got off and he said yes. Then we’re still in this hotel and people are looking at each other with a lot of fear and distrust, moving rooms and packing bags and trying to decide where to go. Now I’m sitting in a hotel room all by myself and preparing to get on an online Zoom call ritual with some sisters. In order to prepare, I first spray the area around me in all directions with a chamomile-based spray. The next procedure in order to sign onto the call is to spray Lysol in every direction, so I do that. Then the scene shifts again. I am at another hotel - it’s a boutique hotel. There is a sinister plot going on - the servants are planning to kill their masters. There are hidden guns and hidden agendas. I can’t recall much more. Then we’re all downstairs at community dinner. More people arrive and a couple are wearing N95 masks over their faces. One of them comes up and stands right behind me and takes off his mask. He wants to introduce me and the little girl sitting in my lap to a friend of his. The little girl is his granddaughter. I’m really upset that he’s breathing on me and that these people walked into our dining room obviously sick and just off a plane or boat. The scene shifts. I’m outside walking along a marina.

As we’re climbing in, a huge fireball shoots over our head and makes a big hole in the wall, going all the way through, singeing everything in the house before making a hole through a bathroom wall and exiting. I’m worried about how the fireball has damaged the house and try to cover up the burned furniture, plants and art. I’m trying to get everyone out and to the street, so we can escape. That’s all we do, or at least all I can recall. In the next scene, I’m standing in a beautiful room on the second floor of a house. There’s a large window with a view of a body of water - either river or ocean. I look up at the sky and the clouds are so beautiful - they look like the white foam of ocean waves. So there is a beautiful body of water below and sky above. I’m in awe. Then a woman comes into the room. She is an indigenous woman with brown skin. She says, “I was referred to you for healing by some women in my Universal Peace Dance Group.” She lists the women, but I don’t recognize their names as members of my practice. Erin and Sophia. So she lies down on the bed - it’s not a chiropractic or massage table, but an actual bed with blankets and pillows. We don’t discuss her history or any of her concerns. I just start working with her and telling her about this work. Her body is responding and moving in a kundalini wave. It’s amazing to witness. Then I notice her hair - it looks like it is growing back from chemotherapy treatments. At the same time, my son is in the kitchen and no one is watching him. He’s playing with the water from the fridge. He’s pouring water into his cup. Then he notices me and comes over. I’m concerned that I don’t have anyone to take care of him and that he’s disturbing the session. But my client doesn’t seem to notice or care that he’s interfering.",

He’s scruffy and older looking of mixed ethnicity - at one point he seems Chinese and another African. I make a move towards the car to tell him to get out, but then he slides a gun across his lap and points it toward me. The gun is upside down and pointed at me as a warning to stay back. So I don't say anything to him. I go back inside and a woman notices that I’m disturbed. She asks me about it, but she can do nothing to help me. So I’m at a loss. The dream shifts to the next day at the same time. I’m waiting for help. He happens to be inside, too.

So we have to guess and give words to the man serving the wine, describing the taste profile or experience we desire. He pulls out a bag of sarsaparilla and cloves and holds it open for us to smell. We enjoy the smell and he gives us a mason jar of red wine that has this flavor profile. While he’s serving us, he tells us that he used to have a job that paid $35/hour and he misses that regular pay because now he is just living on tips. We thank him and each pay him $5 for the wine and $1 tip. He says again, “I still wish I had that job where I was getting paid 35 a month.” I think, “Hmm a month? D...",

    "Dream": "I am in a big boat in the middle of a very choppy, stormy sea. I’m with a group of people. A huge wave comes and crashes over the boat, throwing us all into the water. The water is black from the storm and the night I see this animal that looks like a dead whale being pushed around on the waves. I struggle up to the whale to see if it is alive and if it could be saved. I know it is dangerous, but I do it anyway. As I reach to hold the whale, it turns into a prehistoric or alien creature, close in size to a sea turtle, but alien in shape and texture. Now I’m trying to keep a hold of this creature and bring us both to the shore. I see other people I know in the water and we are all diving under the waves to swim in calmer depths. When I come up for breath, I notice people in rowboats. They are not good people. They are wanting to capture this creature and take it from me. I need to work harder to hold on and swim deep under the water to safety. They see me one time when I go get a breath of air, and I feel like I’m in grave danger. Somehow I get away. I reach an underwater city. I open a door into an empty room and then go through another door to a cobbled street. I am still underwater, but can breathe and move easily. I must keep going and hold this creature close to me because they could get me at any moment. Then in another part of the dream, I am with my friend, George and a friend of his who I don’t know. I have a phone and an iPad. We need to get to a concert and the address and transportation information about the buses are on the devices. I’m worried that it’s time to go and we might miss the first bus. George says, “Don’t worry, we’ll make it.” Then I say I have to put on my makeup. He says, “You don’t need to wear makeup, girl. You’re beautiful. You’re not a baby anymore.”",

    "Dream": "Mary needs heart surgery. The surgery is happening in the back bedroom of a house by a man. She goes back and there are other people with me in the house waiting. It’s nighttime - an unusual time for surgery. When the surgery is over the man says it’s okay for us to go visit her. As I go into the bedroom, I see there are big potted plants - they look like plumeria trees, but aren’t. I’m surprised because just during the short amount of time of the surgery, bright yellow flowers have bloomed on bright yellow stalks. I’ve never seen this before and didn’t know this plant could grow such flowers. I point it out to another woman who is equally amazed. At first I think it was just one big tree, then I see that the “tree” is actually made up of multiple potted plants and maybe these flowers were just brought in, rather than a miracle. Then I see Mary is waking up. The man comes up to me and tells me she will need hot chocolate or matcha for an endorphin boost. He asks if I have either of those in my kitchen, and I think I do - though I’m staying in a rental house and am not sure about what is in the cupboards. He says “Okay, that’s great.” Mary is starting to come back around and is looking around, refreshed but weak. We gather her up and help her out to the kitchen. We need to get her home to rest and have her hot chocolate or matcha. Conversations are happening in the kitchen, but I can't recall what was said. Now we need to get dinner because we missed it while she was in surgery. So we go outside to a village (like Squaw Valley) and down big steps to a dessert cafe. We stand in line at the cafe and I’m now with one of my yoga students and clients, Natalie, and another yoga student. I look in my pockets and realize I don’t have any money. I tell them I need to go home to get money and fill up my pockets. It’s dark and I’m walking down a sidewalk. I see two homeless people who don’t seem quite all together in the head. They are dressed up as Christmas clowns. They are p...",

He says he wants to meet him in hand to hand combat. So the leader agrees. They begin this extreme demonstration of skill. Brad Pitt is wearing a big black trench coat and a mask. The guy tells him that he cannot let go while they are shaking. There’s an odd moment where the two men are in a firm grip, apparently shaking hands, but jaws clenched, muscles rigid, and sweating. All of a sudden, the leader whirls Brad Pitt across the courtyard. He hits a huge door, but then picks up a hose and sprays the leader down with high pressure. He is then accepted into the tribe.",

    "Dream": "This dream is Outlander meets Simpson’s cartoon meets COVID-19. I am observing the dream, like watching a movie, but I also get to enjoy the embraces when they happen. The people in the dream are Jamie and Claire from Outlander - they look like the actors in the TV series - and Jamie’s wife in one of the books, though she doesn’t look like the character in the TV series. Before I see them, I am watching people on rafts in a big wide river. It’s dark, nighttime. The rapids at this part of the river are quite rough and throwing the rafts around. Some people are chasing other people. Someone falls into the river and is nearly drowned by the water and other people holding his head down. Later, people are recovering on the riverbank around bonfires. There are two bonfires near each other. I can see that the outline of the further fire is making outlines of mystical beings. People are being divided into expedition teams to go out into the night again. Then, the COVID/Outlander/Simpsons scene: sometimes the people are portrayed as Simpson cartoons with medical masks. They are also wearing masks in their human form. There are several reunions - it’s like my dream psyche is trying on different scenarios to find the most romantic storyline. One is a kitchen, one is a cave and one is a rock pillar tower underground. Each scene has a collection of colored rocks and Claire and Jamie meeting again for the first time in 11 years with the big embrace and kiss. They are looking at the rocks - plain rocks, but colored naturally in yellows, reds and blues like the rocks at the river near The Painted Hills - in waking life, we went to this river last weekend. While the kiss is happening, the boys walk in. Jamie and Claire have a son and he has two friends - the sons of Jamie’s wife. Their son is happy, but the other two are angry. The kids are Simpson characters. The brothers run off to tell their mom and create danger and drama for the two lovers, interfering with the bliss of their r...",

She’s also pregnant and I can see inside her belly. The baby is breached and I can see the face is looking forward at the level of her belly button and the blond hair floating around like a halo. The question is whether or not to intervene and turn the baby upside down in the right position or leave the baby as is.",

I recognize my friends, Veronica, Gail and Irene. The man has the build of George Floyd. My friends seem to be representing the white women doing anti-racist work. There is another scene where I am leaving an AirBnB house with Veronica, Gail, Irene and my sister. We were on retreat discussing current events, racism and ant-racism. The ladies are getting in the car. I’m hanging around cleaning up the kitchen. The kitchen is a big mess and a woman arrives to help me clean. I’m putting dishes and foods away and making sure we bring home the dishes and foods that belong to us. My son is with the other ladies and they’re waiting for me. They say, “Come on, Viviane. We’re going to get back to the city really late and we’ve gotta go. It’s already after 3 and we won’t be home until after 9 now.” We were supposed to leave in the morning. I’m impressed with how the woman has cleaned the kitchen. I take my son’s hand and we go across the street and across the dirt medium. My friends tell me to watch out for the little dog. I see a mean looking old white man with big lumpy nose and bushy eyebrows. He owns this little yappy dog who has pooped all over the ground. He’s scowling at me and all of us for making noise and being here. My son and I are carefully walking over the dog poop. I see a 3 foot long rope-like piece of poop. We step over it to get in the car. The man continues to glare at us from behind his fence.",

There is a message for us on the tv. The woman next to me somehow revives and comes back to life. We leave together. We are in a big warehouse, a dance audition, all women. Dancers on the beams and in the loft. Women of all colors in form fitting costumes for dancing. Again, somehow, violence threatens and we must run to escape. Now I’m in a loft, a secret high profile dining room, a floating floor surrounded by a transparent net on which lights dance. You can lean into the net as if you’re floating. My sister does this. We are being served cocktails and hor d'oeuvres. There is fear, looking over our shoulders, not knowing who to trust or where we can truly be safe.",

As I look, I realize, it’s not a life-sized cardboard cutout image of her, but it’s actually her. She sees me, releases the pose and walks to me. I am amazed by her height. She is towering over me. I give her a hug and my face is at the level of her yoni. She is about to teach a full day workshop series at the studio. Right now it’s 3am and her first class starts at 5. I have other obligations during the day, so I can't go. I could have gone to this first class, but don’t. I putter around my day. There is a woman that I knew from elementary school. She has rigged the elections to be something like a homecoming queen. There are quite a few obligations and functions she’s participating in to raise funds for the school. She’s doing a great job and has the perfect southern smile and hospitality, but she wasn’t actually fairly elected. The administration realizes it and are debating whether to remove her or keep her because she is doing her job so well and has raised so much money.",

I’m going to a hotel with a small group of people for an educational high level training of some kind. I don’t recall who was there, except for Jeremy. Zoe is still alive, but she’s at their house and near her death. We arrive and are settling in. Somewhere around three o’clock, Jeremy gets a call from Zoe. She's distressed and feels very close to death. He, unusually, denies it and her because she’s been having similar experiences and it’s been more stressful and anxiety producing than real. So he hangs up the phone. I go into meditation. I see her in the courtyard outside their house - but it’s not their house in waking life. She’s dancing barefoot on the concrete ground. She gets really tired and turns off the music. She goes to the deck and lays her head down on the wooden deck and falls asleep for the last time. Somehow, we found out she has died. I know the exact moment because of my vision - it was in that three o’clock afternoon after, like 3:11pm. I gather my things to go with Jeremy over to the house. All the arrangements have been made by her friends. There are interactions in the hotel before we left, but I can’t recall them now. There’s a sense we will be spending the night together. We make the winding drive back along the coast to the house. When we arrive, her friends have laid her body out in the barn. Pema is there along with other friends who I’ve seen in passing. They’re preparing for the funeral or celebration of life. They’re slicing lemons in the kitchen and in the garden gathering flowers. They’re also gathering and writing poetry and preparing for guests. We go inside. People are sitting in rows. I sit by myself at the end of a row. I turn around and there are people looking at me. They are people from my past who I don’t remember as I’ve lived in many places and known many friends and forgotten many people. They share their memories of me and how they h...",

They then start to put foundation on my face - it’s much lighter than my skin tone. They are covering up my natural brows and the rest of my face in a very thick application. I look in the mirror and do like what I see, but am concerned about how I’ll look when the makeup fades during the day and after I wash my face at night. Now, we are entering New York City through a portal. We are taken through a series of halls and rooms, peering in through glass windows. I am taken to a room with a large bed. The man who lives here is very wealthy and eccentric. He has strange sexual tastes and there is an understanding that we all must participate in some way to get out of here and continue on our journey. Now I'm in a basement or garage with a team. We need to find clues; each clue leads to the next. We’re doing well, but someone has tampered with the room and one of the clues in the sequence is missing. The floor is grey cement. There are shelves of books and odds and ends. There are other odd contraptions throughout the space. It’s dark with just a dim garage light. I’m now going to a performance in a theater. My husband and I don’t have tickets. When we arrive, they show us to our box seats. I see a friend from town and her husband. Their son is just a few days older than my son. We are taken to the seats front and center - very conspicuous. Now, I am in the portal rooms again. The man is in bed under the covers with at least three other people. I am standing at the side of the bed and ask him about the mattress composition. He says it’s made of wormwood. Interesting. There are beads of creamy substance in the seams. I pick them up and roll them into a ball and think it’s some kind of glue leaking through. I show it to him and ask him what it is. He pops it in his mouth, eats it and gives me a look. He laughs at m...",

I also see Tan France from the “Queer Eye” show. We realize that if we stay here, our lives will be in danger. We don’t open the door and we don’t let them in, but they know we’re inside. Eventually they give up for now and drive away. We know that if we stay, it could be a problem. We pack up and bring our plant starters in the RV. We drive a bit and are supposed to rendezvous with someone with a mask to buy and bring to my brother-in-law. We park the RV in a field for the night. A big truck comes driving towards us really fast and stops just in front of us. We’re afraid it might keep going and run into us. Someone knocks on our door, but we don’t want to open the door because we don’t know who they are or what they could bring with them. They end up opening the door themselves. I see a couple Latina girls. We know their family and realize these are the people who we are supposed to meet up with. The mom and dad come in and we’re concerned that all these people are in a small space. She shows us this mask - it’s like a Gonzo mask, rubber and blue with a bulbous nose - one of her creations. She shows us how to wear it - she puts it over her nose and then says, “When I take it off, I just pull it down over my waist like this.” I don’t think she realizes how this looks like a strap-on.",

A nurse is sitting at a desk and we line up in front of her. I’m about in the middle of the line. The nurse is spraying a vaccine mist for SARS-CoV-2 in front of each person’s nose and requiring them to sniff deeply to bring it in. She does not explain what it is or how it works. I comply the first time because it does not seem too harmful for my body, but I try not to breathe it in deeply. But the next time around, she takes out a long thin needle connected to a vat of the vaccine. When it’s my turn, I say no. I am firm but non-violent in my resistance. She has been prepared for this scenario. So instead of poking me with the needle, she pushes a stronger dose of the nasal mist up into my nostrils. I can’t breathe through my right nostril at first, but she continues to be steady and persistent in her administration of the proper dose. I do eventually take it in. i am allowed to go home. I stop at a doctor’s office for some reason. I see another mother from town.

I go in with my son and we say hello. He climbs up on the different beds. I recognize one person as a patient of mine in waking life. We go into a room we’ve stayed in before. Instead of two beds, this room now has four. I look for mine. I see my friend Dee. People are talking about the pluses and minuses of this new situation. It’s less expensive at least. We go downstairs to a packing and shipping operation. We are being forced into this labor. It’s a Facebook meets Amazon thing. The man is showing us what we need to do. A crane is lifting a huge heavy box filled with rubber masks. It brings it to a truck to be shipped. Now we are all made to sit at our stations and are then given a box of cardboard envelopes. We are supposed to open the box and remove the ten envelopes. I open an envelope, stuff it with a rubber mask and a flyer with the image of an American flag, then lick the flap, seal it closed and put it in another box. We are all doing this. I’m nearly done with my box when I get to an envelope that is deformed. The flap is difficult to open - it’s wrinkled and torn. Once I put the mask in the envelope, I have a really hard time closing it and sealing it. I’m concerned that they’ll come by and look at my work and my work will be unacceptable. I have a sense of my grandmother’s presence for a bit, but then she moves on. They do come by and give me this look and make a note on their clipboard, so now I’m being watched more carefully. Then we are ushered over to a grassy hill, like an outdoor amphitheater. I see Dee again.

    "Dream": "It’s night. I’m downtown in an urban environment that I don’t recognize. I’m with a group of people. We are going to meet up with another group and have dinner. It’s strange when our groups meet as we are all standing around with our arms down, wondering whether to hug each other in greeting or not. The COVID social awkwardness is adding to the standing awkwardness that comes with greeting people for the first time. We go inside. There’s a table for us upstairs. We order and eat. I see a very pregnant woman about to go into labor. They hurry her to a hospital. I’m looking at her and horrified by the idea of giving birth with a mask on. I couldn’t even wear earrings when I was giving birth. People disperse in an unremarkable way. Later in the dream, some guys are building a carnival playset with pipes. You climb up the pipes, do some athletic exercises at the top, then go down the slide. They remove some of the stations on the top part so that it’s not quite as challenging and people can go up, stand and look out, then go down the slide. A strong burly guy climbs up. He does pull ups at the top, then slides down. I notice that he is a bit wider than the slide. The contraption isn’t entirely ready, but they let him test it out. I wonder if they should add some rings for swinging. They aren’t meeting any safety regulations and I can see that a person could lose their balance at the top and fall to the ground if they do too much.",

    "Dream": "I’m standing on a street corner on the sidewalk. I’m waiting to cross the street. A woman comes up to me. She’s tall, slim, with blond straight hair. She is well put together and wearing a royal blue pantsuit. She’s upset. I talk to her about the psychic healing system I work with. She asks me a question about it then walks a little away. I am not facing her but can see her as if I’m looking through a rearview mirror. She turns and walks back to me and asks more questions. She wants to know if it’s possible to do a healing for herself. Then she asks if I can do a healing for her team. I say yes because she is a representative of her team. Then she asks if I can do a healing for her husband and his team. I think that if they’re all in the same company and connected, then I could probably do that. Slowly it comes out that she has missed an important deadline for work for applying for a grant. She’s really upset about this missed opportunity. She works with exotic wildlife, particularly exotic cats. I become lucid in the dream and rise up partially out of it. I realize I have just missed by a few hours an opportunity to apply for a business grant for COVID relief. My mind starts ticking away trying to figure out how to apply anyway and ask for an extension. I hope I can write and ask for the deadline extension because I have a toddler at home that I’m taking care of nearly full time.",

We are throwing things in the water that float on the surface and attract fish. My son has a life vest on. As we are turning the boat around, I throw my son into the water so he will swim. I thought the boat was going to stop but it keeps on going. My son is in the water and I’m looking to see if he is still floating. I see him on the wake from another boat. So when the boat swings around, I see him and my heart is relieved to see him floating and riding the wave with his head turned to the side. It looks like he’s having a good time. I lean over and pull him up by the life vest back onto the boat. The boat pulls over to a grassy bank. We get out. There are picnic tables and a few families are camping and getting a meal ready. My son just invites himself to join, immediately finding the kids and playing with them. I’m looking around and notice it’s children and elderly people, no one in between. Somehow, I have the birth records of all the people. I’m looking through the papers and see that there’s an 11 year old girl, a 9 year old boy, a 91 year old man and a 90 year old woman. I’m a little concerned for their health and COVID risk. Then I go inside one of the cabins. A puppet show is happening, a story of creation. Matthew Fox is doing the puppet show with airplanes and boats. He’s making them fly and telling the history of human innovation. Then in another scene, we are with a couple friends, Molly and Aster (co-owners of a Yoga School I helped maange) getting ready to go snowboarding. Aster and my husband have traded boards. Then Aster takes her board back. It’s really rough and she hasn’t had it cleaned up from the year before when she was boarding over slushy snow and rocks. It’s quite damaged, but she is whispering to the board and asking it to be rideable for this day. In another scene, I’m at a celebration for Ted, an award’...",

There are plates of mostly eaten food, spaghetti and such - basic American restaurant food. People are singing at the front. Each table begins to sing one at a time except for mine. Then next to me is a table with my friends, George and Kayla. George starts to speak like an African American preacher and says it like it is. They’re on their way to a conference or retreat. Then one of my past yoga teachers comes by my table and says something about the music and the retreat she led and how every spot was full even though it was COVID, people needed retreat.",

A group of us are gathered for the recording. The intro to the podcast is recorded by an Asian woman in a relationship with a black man. She is describing their relationship and it’s recorded like a guided meditation in a semi-darkened room. Then the lights turn on and Gwen is speaking about inter-racial relationships between white women and black men. I’m sitting beside her as support. The scene opens up and a white woman and black man are running. People are chasing and trying to track them down. They separate for safety and hope they can find each other again.",

There is an order for who is to get the food first, but there are mothers of young children who are pushing to the front and making a mess of things with their plates. They are shouldering in front of each other and getting more food than they are allotted or is appropriate for the number of people who are here. The food gets to be more and more of a mess and spreading on the table and falling to the ground. A woman is next to me with three plates. She is justifying her actions saying, “This is for my son and this is for my daughter and this is for my husband.” She keeps putting more and more pieces on her plate while people are hungrily pushing forward against us. I have my plate and at first just cut one piece, but then I get just a little more, then just a little more, beginning to feel the scarcity of hunger and not knowing if there will be enough. Then I’m upstairs in the same building and alone. It’s an old stone building without windows, but rather openings carved into the thick stone walls. There are two young boys who have been brainwashed in some way. They are putting stones in the openings to cover the light. As they do this, they are turning the building into marsh. I can see green vines growing from wherever they touch. I’m panicking then trying to control my breath and clear my mind so I can make a plan to save this all from collapsing and turning into marsh.",

I look at her and say to her, “Oh, you’re attracting more bugs.” She laughs. A tall white woman with blonde hair is sitting across from us. I don’t recognize her from waking life. She is holding feathers. She says, “It would be nice if we could bless the elements and call in the ancestors because we really need to talk to the ancestors. We begin the ceremony. Alice is playing music. It’s kind of off. Alice is playing pop songs and I’m trying to lead an embodiment practice and meditation. We are not in sync.

It won’t be a real use of my skills, but it’s a great situation. She’ll pay me $4,518 a month to live in the house and to respond to calls and visitors. I will also have time to do some sessions. I’ll pay $505 a month for my room and board in the house. I’m sitting across the desk from her in her office. She has all the papers prepared with the tax calculations. I sign the papers and feel at ease. I can relax into this time with a steady monthly paycheck and a safe place to live that is run by people with integrity and enough money to be generous. In another scene, I’m standing in the rain outside Whole Foods. It’s dark. I’m with my mom and grandmother. It’s COVID times so we have to wait to get in. They let us in and we put our masks on. We can’t ask for help because people aren’t available in the aisle. We are looking for breadcrumbs. We separate and my grandmother finally finds the aisle with the breadcrumb choices. I was getting frustrated walking around and around the store. But my grandmother shows me options. There’s one with mushrooms, which I say no to because of my sister’s allergy. Another is made of potato chips and I think that could be interesting, so it’s a maybe. There’s another one with some other flavors in a big pink bag. None are exactly right, but I have to choose something and stand in line again to purchase it. In another scene, there is a group of men, mostly African American. They are setting up a nice area for themselves with a firepit, matching tables and chairs. They’ve created something beautiful. We are all sitting around outside in the dark around separate fire pits. Most of us are striving to get by and have mismatched sets of chairs and such.",

We’re watching the way the fire is spreading. We decide to wait a while longer because my husband is supposed to meet us here. As we wait and watch, the fire continues to grow. It looks like it’s coming down our side of the mountain towards us. Suddenly, it’s not just a fire, it’s red lava flowing down the mountain. We realize the mountain is actually an active volcano. We get into the RV and even though it’s mine, I don’t know how to drive it. The man gets in the driver’s seat and he’s only driven an RV of this size maybe once. He gets behind the wheel and is driving as quickly and safely as he can down this rough dirt road to get us away from the fire and lava. We can feel its heat. We know there are other people in the woods who we were supposed to meet up with and we hope they’re finding a way out.",

I have my phone in my hand and have opened an event calendar app. I see that a friend from high school is putting on a show. Her name is Kali and the show is called “Kali’s Eyes.” I'm really interested in this. I tap on the arrow on the screen to get more information, but the app isn’t functioning well and I can’t find what I’m looking for. I am frustrated but I keep walking and hoping I’ll happen upon the event. I end up at a crowded venue. It looks like there will be a performance soon. I walk through the different rooms. Musicians are setting up. I see a guy with dreads who I think might be DJ Drez and some others. I could stay but I keep walking to check out the whole venue. Each room has a different feel, some with couches for lounging, some set up for lunch or dinner, some more open for music and dancing. I turn around to go back and now it’s really crowded. I’m trying to pass through the restaurant setting and there is a bachelorette party or sorority reunion. The women are crowded around tables that they’ve pushed together. I have to ask them to move their chairs so I can get through. I realize I can’t even walk through because the tables are pressed against the wall. I’m frustrated. It’s also still COVID, so it’s uncomfortable for me to be so close to so many people all crowded together. I do make it through by pushing the tables away from the wall just enough to squeeze by. I make it back to the more open room for music and dancing. People are more distanced here and tables are set up around the perimeter. I am uncomfortable because I have to sit at a table that’s already occupied by people who are in the stoned yoga art community. They kind of welcome me but I feel out of place. I get up and walk to the back of the room where a buffet brunch is set up. There is an empty chair that I’d like to sit on, but they’ve roped it off and set a warming plate on...",

There are mountains around. I go inside the dining area and check things. We all have to be absolutely silent. I go outside again where people are camped out and hidden, waiting for news. I go back inside. There are stuffed animals all around. Two of the stuffed animals have been unstuffed and then filled with flesh colored thick soupy material that is now pouring out and corroding the floor. I pick them up and take them outside to show the people camped by the water to show them what’s happening. I go back inside to pick up blankets. When I look out the window, the water looks like it’s raining with droplet impressions, but there’s no rain falling from the sky. I try to jump over rocks to get to where the others are hiding. I miss the last rock and one of my feet steps in the water. It’s thicker and more viscous than water and I’m afraid it’s toxic. I pull my leg out quickly and keep going. I see only footprints because everyone has left. I’m worried about why they left so quickly and wonder where they are, if they’ve just gone over the bank to hide or have gone much further. For some reason I can’t follow them. I go back inside and get in line, pretending to be compliant. Others are standing silently in line, waiting to order their food. I’m silent, too. I leave the line and go back outside. People are waiting in the dark for a New Year’s Eve experience. It will be digitized and they’ll be able to watch it by their minds being projected upon. I see a young man who is half Asian, half white, or some kind of mix. We had arranged to escape together. But now, he is enamored by the projection that has been promised to him.

I go all the way down to the last room. There are no doors. I walk in and go to the sink. I look down to my left and see a big communal bath that has been drained of water. There are brightly colored square pillows arranged in a circle in preparation for a sound bath or meditation of some kind. Two people, a young man and woman, are sitting in the center with their backs to each other and their arms hooked. They look like the typical kind of people you’d see at Esalen before it became more popularized and fancy. They are startled when they see me and yelp and move away from each other as if being close to each other is not allowed and they don’t want to be seen breaking the social rules. I don’t care about the rules though. I go back out and see one of my patients walking down the hall with her child. She doesn’t have a child in waking life, but this girl is a toddler. There’s a black leather wallet on the ground being pushed to the side. It’s open and I can see folded bills and credit cards. I feel like I need to explain myself to my patient and let her know we didn’t quarantine because we were isolated while we were away. Then my son comes running down the hall. He’s wild and out of control like he’s been in waking life. It’s so hard to know what to do with him. Later in the dream I’m hiding out in the car, getting a moment to myself. My husband is dropping our son off at a communal outside area with green grass, dome huts and underground rooms, like a hobbit village. While I’m hiding out in the car, a family I know comes by and they knock on the window. They have two daughters, one the same age as my son and the other just over one.

There are plastic bumpers on the road. It kind of also reminds me of the Pensacola Beach bridge. It’s a bit dangerous because of the speed and height, and there are only minimal guy wires on either side with a lot of strong wind. We barely stay on the road. We are trying to escape something. In another earlier time in the dream, I’m in a cozy house. I’m giving a healing session to a contemporary dancer. Her body is very slight but strong. As I begin working on her, she’s lying next to the fireplace on a folded blanket. Her body moves a lot and she leaps off onto a yoga mat. Then at one point her physical body is kneeling next to mine and we are both working together on her energetic body. The yoga mat leaps away as if her energy body is full of electricity and vitality. We look at each other and laugh with joy at the power of life. As we finish up, she asks for the time. It’s 9pm and it’s time for her to go to rehearsal. She gets up and leaves quickly. I follow her out because I need to go somewhere. She goes into the house next door. I’m surprised because I thought it was empty - the family living there just recently moved to a bigger, nicer house. Maybe she’s renting it while it’s waiting to sell. The house next door to that one is owned by a family with a few kids. They’re getting into their van. I see my son running past their house on the sidewalk and to the corner intersection. I’m running after him so he doesn’t run into the road. Everyone in the family has a long carrot tied to their noses and they look like Pinnochio noses. I think it’s odd, but just yell hello to them as I run after my son who is wild and excited. Then in an earlier part of the dream, I’m on a college campus. Liam is part of this mission.

I don't’ recognize anyone else in my group from waking life. He’s put together a routine for us to perform with him. I’m his assistant. He is telling me about the routine where he’ll make someone float and make them appear to be him. The person he points out is a young girl with long red hair like him. She is unconscious or asleep. We go up the stairs to the stage and he places her on a table. He tosses a blue blanket over her naked body. I’m concerned for her modesty and adjust the blanket as he begins the show. He begins the act and somehow he raises her from the table so she’s floating in the air. This is supposed to be the peak of the performance. There was another part where he made other images of himself, one where he is an older version of himself with a bulbous nose and greying hair. At the end of the routine there isn’t a lot of applause and we all return to our seats. Other presentations continue on the stage. JP Spears is now lying across the top of the seats in front of me.

When they recognized her, they knew they could switch and get to know the other community. She said yes, knowing they needed a break - knowing more in an omniscient way. It starts with me in a women’s camp environment - it was a futuristic settlement. Everyone wore farmhouse settler dresses and also face masks. This is a landscape I’ve been dreaming of all month but haven’t remembered any details until this episode. I discovered my twin doppelgänger and they had dominion over a galactic camp nearby. They looked like me - their appearance was female but they wore a burdensome huge mask covering head, face and shoulders with interlocking hydraulics spiked around the base. They’re in prairie dresses, but wearing steampunk style masks. You can’t tell who they are because they’re dressed the same and covering their faces. People aren’t addressing each other by name and interacting all day, but not in a personal way. They discovered me from a televised program I was on about agricultural excursions into the reaches of the community borders and asked to do an identity swap. I agreed but was scared. There was a salon area of town with “bars” like downtown but they were only big enough for 2 people each - like a redlight district. These are social distancing bars with screens at each bar, so you can join other people in conversation. It’s psychedelic with bright lights, but it’s dumpy, everything is falling apart. It reminds me of Blade Runner. Mischievous activity is afoot. There were men there. I was doing some restoration work on a building and my two nieces were underfoot chasing each other while I worked. I was stuccoing a building but in a beautiful artistic way with different plant dyed materials and kind of a dancing live art piece. There was a beautiful man dancing and I really wanted hi...",

I gave her some art and she loved it but wanted to take it somewhere to be finished. I was visiting a hotel and I couldn’t afford to stay there, I was waiting for a friend that had a room key. Staff kind of found me locked in the hallway with posters, I was staging a protest the following day. I had a million bags and posters and markers and nothing was organized. I felt really flustered. There was a family of 8 that needed help figuring out how to get jobs and who was old enough to work and I couldn’t figure out what they should do.",

I had a boy and I went crazy. My experience with this indigenous woman opened my eyes to the injustice of what was happening around me. I self medicated with alcohol. We lived in a small apartment above a bakery building. I was the town crazy person. When my child was about seven I totally lost it and was taken away. I think the jail or something like that or a nut house. I knew I was about to be taken and I can still see the look on my son's face when I told him I would never see him again and I was so sorry to leave him alone in a town where he really didn’t belong. I wished I could take him to his tribe back to his people because I knew these people wouldn’t care for him.",

The kids immediately played in the tiny atrium in our apartment that had a tree and some animals. Margaret hugged Angela and we all sat down to have some snacks and tea and the kiddos sat around and listened to stories of revolution!",

There were tons of community gathering places— there was a space for black men and boys to gather and workout and be in community, right next to the juice bar in a beautiful part of the block. There were rainbows and murals on buildings. There was a long line at the juice bar and my sister and I were looking for a new apartment for her but we couldn’t find the location we were given. We decided to just enjoy the day anyway and get a juice and hang out in the garden. We went back to my place and I walked over to my friend Nikki’s because we were going to go out that night together. We were driving and all of a sudden there was some kind of lock down/shut down. Two cars blocked our exit and we were kind of stuck inside a parking structure. The lights were all shut off and it was pitch black. We were driving slowly and then I started screaming for her to stop driving and insisted that we had to get out and walk. I couldn’t explain to her that we were driving over black and brown humans that were laying face down. I saw what we were doing but didn’t know how to stop it.",

We were all in outside buildings/ structures in our village; there were no doors or roofs. Everyone was tending things. I was watching the children and a spider crawled up my arm to tell me something, looked at me, and bit me. And I was bleeding. I was lying on an outdoor lounge bed thing and the blankets were all white and a drop of blood fell onto the blankets. So I told Sofia there would be blood. She came into the bed and everyone else did, too. We all cuddled and sang something I can’t remember. And she went off. When she came back she had blood for us to drink And told us we were free.

My childhood home was on a really busy street and I would often see people that I knew drive by and some people would stop by if we were outside in the front. We were sitting at a picnic table on the corner and some people started trickling in from my past and it was like a block party. There was food and people were singing karaoke I think or call in response and the party kept going until the evening. This girl that I don’t know who kind of looks like Avril Lavigne but more severe came through. Everyone really liked her and she was very charismatic and kind of abrupt, but in a way that was charming. She started singing and then into the evening she started singing worship songs like Jesus church songs. I was like what is this? I wasn’t down but everyone was immediately down and then at the end of the evening she pulled me and Bea aside and started talking about her funeral. We didn’t know her so we asked, “Oh are you like terminally ill?” and she’s like, “No, but I plan to die tonight.” Again I’m shook, but Bea seemed fine. She proceeded to tell us that she wanted us to sacrifice her to absolve humanity of its burdens and sins, like she was the second coming of Christ - she didn’t say that but that was the vibe. I didn’t want to do it but everyone else seemed totally down to do it. I also didn’t believe her that she wanted to do that. I kind of thought that maybe she was suicidal but because she was so religious she couldn’t kill herself so she needed somebody else to do it, so she was using the situation to her advantage to get into heaven. We turned on the incinerator which for some reason was in my backyard and prepping for the sacrifice. I asked her what she wanted her story to be when people were investigating this act and she said that no one would find out that it happened so there wouldn’t be an investigation and then I woke up.",

Other women from my team joined and there was a ceremony. He kept trying to relate to me and I was cordial. We were in a stadium and as we were waiting I sunk into Warrior 1 pose deeply bending my right knee. I raised my arms and readjusted my back left leg as it was very wide out.

The song is “I’ll fly away.” Suddenly I realized we were at a funeral and the second line was coming.

One of the PTs who is assigned to my unit but also works COVID came over to me, I saw her and she smiled. She had a rainbow around her, like reflected off of her. She sat down and said “we have to show them all how to love, okay?” She was very serious. I nodded. This was not what I was expecting, given her personality. I asked if something was wrong. She just seemed changed like a layer removed and older. It was dark and gray and blue and she was so colorful.",

This woman had to be the driver and it was like these go-karts on a roller coaster almost and we went straight at first and then we made a turn and she was like “oh shit” and we had to go completely vertical and we did. We went to the top and it was like we were in New York but San Francisco at the same time. The woman who was driving it was black and it was this mixed group cross-section of American society.",

    "Dream": "I’m talking to someone else remembering a time with my daughter. I’m a black woman - black with very little hair and a strong body. My daughter and I ran away. I think I’ve dreamt about them before running. This dream was both flashing back to the work on something that looked like present day and then flashing to a memory reel, some of it like old pictures. The current flash was this embodied sense of hard work - we were working with a group of people on these box cars to outfit them for something; there was conflict and confusion amongst us but out in the world there was war. We had to work stealth and fast, always at night and these boxcars had to be undetected. The flash to the scenes with the daughter haunt me. I can almost hear her voice and she’s talking about going to New York City and riding around in the backs of trucks and the image is the mother and daughter in a black and white picture in the back of an old truck holding onto a mattress and the narrator is talking about letting her daughter decide where to go and zooming in on the daughter’s face smiling but it’s sad and creepy feeling like something bad happened to the daughter and it just made me want to turn my light on as I write this. It’s in black and white. Then I woke up.",

But with strangers in the dream on the last day he came to see me we went to go have a meal and it was COVID and he had been having a meal with somebody the day before and I was really nervous about it, so I suggested just staying at home. Something happened during the meal where he just stopped talking and he was telling me how much he loved me and he was wearing a red shirt. I don’t know, but for some reason I felt like it was the last time I would see him and he looked a little younger maybe like he would’ve 15 years ago during this dream.

We drove by an outdoor jewelry store (all stores have moved outside) and I thought I saw people taking things and commented that if I was security I would have to be careful not to assume everyone was guilty. Then I was in an apartment with a woman who reminded me of a famous actress and people from work - we were going to make a meal for everyone and it was a big deal. We wore name tags and I had a bandaid on my finger that kept slipping off. The woman was annoyed with me...she was very polished. When we were all settled I pulled four Oracle tree cards for the table and then went around the table to have people pull their cards based on the four I pulled, and read them. I got to the first person and then the second person was the security guard at my unit, this huge guy named Arshis. He’s been in my dreams before. He pulled a card I knew what it would be because when I pulled it I knew it was his, and I said “I knew you would pull that card!” And I started to read it but couldn’t pronounce some of it. It was in Polynesian and then I said “love.” He looked out the window and there was smoke billowing out of the windows of the building to the right of us, like a c-shaped building, and we all went back to our rooms to change and grab our bags to evacuate. The lights went out and I couldn’t find any clothes that fit. Then I woke up and my heart was racing.",

    "Dream": "Whoa. I was at a magical place that had been deserted on the coast. The top was a big meeting type area and if you hiked down about halfway there was a pool and hot tub in the woods with cool lights, and then another mile down was the ocean. Imagine like a tropical Esalen with a mile between cliffs and beach where you could reach the beach safely and warm enough to swim all the time. The first part of my dream I was exploring this landscape alone and barely came across other people. The second time the dining area had reopened and I was in line for dessert and there was cheesecake, but everything looked fake, like not real food. The next time I was there for a weekend with a group of people, all younger than me. We went all the way down to the ocean water and it was pitch black but we lit it up somehow by swirling around in the water, and people were standing and sitting on the edge watching us. It was provocative but not blatantly sexual; it felt more like we were sharing love than having sex but to outsiders, someone commented when we were walking back up “thanks for the show, I’ve been here 60 years and never seen one like that.” I felt embarrassed at the time, like they thought we were disinhibited on drugs or drunk but we weren’t. Then we started walking to the top and it wasn’t nighttime anymore but no sun; it was all gray. There were people who looked homeless (holding small signs) seated wedged in with people enjoying the view. There was an ex boyfriend of mine from high school and I went to say hi. He made a comment about me being seen down below and something about white girls (he is black If this is something meaningful) and seemed angry with me. This was not the response I would expect after 20 plus years of not seeing each other. Then there were more people out and I started walking towards the entrance when three people with huge banners came tumbling down into the crowd and someone yelled “get them out of there! Here we go again!” and it was the peopl...",

The OT room was empty and I was putting things away and my laundry basket was there from home for some reason. I looked up and didn’t see cameras in the room (many of the work areas have cameras) so I started taking my clothes off, but before I could change someone came in and was like, “they can see you!” So I ran out naked. I saw one of the security people behind a booth and he also had his shirt off. I went to go see what was going on. He said it was all clear. I went back to the room and two of my colleagues came in laughing and talking about hair dye. I went for a walk and suddenly was below deck. I went to try to get up but there was only a ladder and I was wearing a backpack and felt unsteady when I got to the top rung, so I got down and when I did there was a man trying to escape/elope! He was wearing a green and white neon shirt and holding a bag. He saw me and tried to run and other people were chasing him, too. Then I went back up on an elevator and it was huge. I saw the security guard Arshis as he was leaving for the day and I said, “I’ll walk out with you.” I walked to the train station off of the dock of the boat. I got on the train. We sat down and both of our shirts were off. I just put my head on his shoulder and sank into him. It felt safe. It wasn’t sexual, it wasn’t even really romantic. Our heads were close together and I remember thinking in the dream that he could kiss me and I wouldn’t stop him but that would ruin the moment.",

It was late early morning and one of the caregivers (a daughter caring for her father) from my caregiving group when Caleb was sick happened to be on that unit (it’s not something that would happen in real life. They live in a completely different state, but there she was and she was in the group). She went back to her room and a nurse came to tell me that she died in her sleep, but that it did not look like suicide (that’s what we’re always worried about at work). It looks like she just went to bed and fell asleep and died. Somebody said she was done with caregiving and she had nothing left.",

I walked into a room with a patient on the table and they said “how long was he gone? It seemed like he developed another consciousness in a short time when he woke up with somebody else,” like a patient died but they woke up and they were somebody else. I walked by shrugging my shoulders like “yup, that happens!” It was very nonchalant. Pinto (my dog) and I are in a different apartment and I don’t think I am me now. It was vintage modern design and had a lot of dog toys including a play castle that took up a lot of space. He wasn’t able to play on it much but it was his favorite (no idea in real life). There were workers not wearing masks in the hallway and I yelled at them. They were putting a clear outer door over all the unit doors. It was a hallway that looked familiar but not mine (like the apartment). Pinto and I went to go see dog friends, Chuck and Trevor, and somehow Chuck was a small dog maybe a wiener mix. I knew that I used to have them together or that they belonged together. Then he morphed into a golden red Chuck similar to now but younger. Trevor was there and the same as he is in real life. We were on wooden outdoor stairs over water, maybe at a wharf, and the leashes kept getting tangled but I couldn’t see the other owner. I assumed it was my ex Rory, but it was like we didn’t know him.",

I got livid mad and cursed her out. She was going to book the next appointment and I told her, “No fucking way.” (In real life I have an amazing therapist so no idea what this is about). Then I left and I was naked in a wheelchair going down the halls and knew I needed clothes so I got gray sweatpants from the closet (the same hospital kind we offer our homeless patients). Then I think I went into a new dream. I was looking for my dog Pinto and was walking through what looked like a school but it was a physical therapy office or rec center. I saw some of my inpatient psych patients (in my dream I recognized them as clear as day as former patients but now that I’m thinking about them I can’t recall their faces). They were all older women. They were walking down a hallway with a PT taking turns getting treatment. One was on oxygen. They looked at me and I looked at them but didn’t say anything for their privacy. I went through double doors and there was an indoor pool and Pinto was there at the end of it with some people and maybe my sister Sarah. I said I was worried about him hanging around there this year because he is not doing well and I don’t want him to fall or step in the pool and drown. They told me they wouldn’t let it happen. But I wouldn’t leave. Then I woke up because Pinto woke up.",

I was nervous about it and I wasn’t wearing a mask, but I was covering my face with a white tissue. We were all driving somewhere and then we pulled over to this big dusty parking lot. We were going to get in the shuttles and I got really nervous about going in the shuttle. This big group of kids on tricycles and other things came charging through the parking lot. They were all black kids on tricycles and some other things. It looked like they knew where they were going. The next thing that happened was everybody came down a tube-like thing, like a slide, and one at a time. My nieces came down. Then my sister had a guy there and I didn’t like him. I knew that it wasn’t my ex brother-in-law but he had a similar energy and he was trying to impress the family. I did not like him at all and my sister was nervous about him meeting the family. She took forever to come down on her slide turn. Then we were in this car and I was trying to put these credit card numbers in and take turns with other people I don’t know. We’re in really close quarters trying to get these credit cards to work before we got to the game. Then I was carrying the speaker box and the front of it had lights in a Christmas tree design. Everybody was commenting on how fast it was for the game but I was really nervous about going somewhere in public.",

We all grabbed hands (almost like in a formation like what it looks like when skydivers do a circular formation) and we were like “hold on!!!!!!” We went under the water and tumbled around.

It wasn’t at my hospital but it was like a similar situation to mine. It looked like a smaller local hospital somewhere. I got a day off and I went to check out this local restaurant (in real life I haven't gone to any restaurants, just take out and delivery). In the dream it almost looked like I was in a different state entirely. It was heavily wooded and more rural. I drove up to this huge house looking thing that happened to be a restaurant and there was a line of people outside. These two men were out there and they seemed nice. It seems like they are brothers, they're both wearing red plaid shirts like flannel and they invited us in for a tour, It was like we were there for something other than just to get food, like it was some kind of extra offering. We went inside. They showed us the billiards room and sat down and were talking, The guy who was leading it made an offhand racist comment. I can’t remember what it was but I didn’t say anything the first time and then the second time he said something and I was in a room and I realized everybody else was white. I put my hand up and I called him out on it and then he started questioning me and qualifying me and then he used the N-word. I got mad and left and he was snorting at me and making a big deal out of it. I think for some reason in my mind we were friends on Facebook and I went to go unfriend him and his name was Dave Ohlone. As I’m writing this I realize that I am on native Ohlone land! It was dark and I remember being mad that I spent my day off going to this thing and being really disappointed in these people.",
