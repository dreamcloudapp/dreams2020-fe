The troop movement comes after Tuesday’s attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq by dozens of Iran-supported militiamen. U.S. Marines were immediately sent from Kuwait to reinforce the compound. In announcing the new deployment, Defense Secretary Mark Esper didn’t specify where the infantry battalion from the Army's 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, would be heading. But a U.S. official tells The Associated Press they'll go to Kuwait and a full brigade of about 4,000 soldiers may eventually be sent.",

Tuberculosis kills more than a million people a year, mostly in poor countries. The only vaccine protects babies but is far less effective at preventing teens and adults from getting the deadly lung infection. In tests with monkeys, researchers found the vaccine worked dramatically better when injected straight into the bloodstream instead of today's skin-deep shot. More safety studies are needed before the approach is tested in people. Wednesday's findings are in the journal Nature. ",

Alabama’s lone Democratic House member on Friday announced her support for the former vice president. Terri Sewell marks Biden's 11th endorsement from the Congressional Black Caucus, more than any other 2020 Democrat. Sewell also expands Biden’s footprint across the critical slate of March 3 Super Tuesday states. Sewell tells The Associated Press that Biden has a strong record on voting rights, health care and other matters critical to her district. And Sewell says Biden is Democrats' best candidate to take on President Donald Trump. Sewell calls the Republican president the “No. 1 threat' to Martin Luther King Jr.'s civil rights legacy.",

When Trump spoke to the American Farm Bureau Federation's convention last year, he urged farmers to have his back. They'd been suffering financially in the fallout from his China trade war. Trump's follow-up speech Sunday in Austin, Texas, gave him a chance to make the case that he kept two of his trade promises. Trump signed a preliminary trade deal with China last week. He's expected to sign the North American trade agreement soon. Trump told the convention: “We did it.”",

Georgetown University said this month it'll end private investments in coal, oil and gas companies within the next decade, and some faculty at Harvard have called for a similar shift. Yale faculty on Thursday will discuss the university's ethical obligations on fossil fuel investments. Several dozen schools have stopped investing at least partially, but there's debate over how much it slows the effects of climate change or affects company bottom lines.",

The Feb. 8 election brought a breakthrough for left-wing nationalists Sinn Fein at the expense of the two long-dominant centrist parties, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael. Fianna Fail and Sinn Fein each hold 37 seats in the 160-seat parliament, while Fine Gael has 35. Thursday’s session saw leaders of all three parties nominated for Taoiseach, or prime minister. But none got enough votes to be elected. Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar resigned as prime minister after the votes, though he will stay as caretaker until a successor is chosen.",

King County officials announced this week that they are buying the motel for $4 million. The deal is expected to close on Friday and officials hope to have the first patients in within days.

The CNN lawsuit says the campaign was damaged by an assertion in a website opinion piece that the idea of Russia helping in 2020 was still on the table. CNN said it would not comment on the lawsuit; other critics say the cases are designed to send a message to the press to not mess with Trump.",

The court says in a unanimous decision that the government had overreached in prosecuting Bridget Kelly and Bill Baroni for their roles in a political payback scheme that created days of traffic jams near the George Washington Bridge. Their aim was to punish a New Jersey mayor who refused to endorse the reelection of then-Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican. The justices say there was evidence of deception, corruption, and abuse of power in the political payback saga. But the ruling says “not every corrupt act by state or local officials is a federal crime.” ",

The Pentagon says its goal in pursuing what President Donald Trump calls “super-duper' missiles is 'to dominate future battlefields.” Hypersonic weapons are at the heart of the Trump administration's worries about China and Russia, which are arguably ahead in this chase. The missiles and aerial vehicles fly at speeds of a mile a second or faster and maneuver in ways that make them extra difficult to detect and destroy in flight. Critics question the need for them. But the Defense Department has more than doubled its spending on research, development and testing of them since 2018.",

Even worse, in the streets of Paris, London or Brussels, mask-wearing — a long-accepted measure in some Asian cities — would often trigger unease and angst related to real-life traumatic bloodshed orchestrated by balaclava-led commandos from extremist groups. But in the space of just a few weeks this spring, this narrative has been turned upside down. Masks are everywhere and carry a new meaning.",

The book, 'Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man,” is expected to contain a number of allegations about Trump's behavior, including his derisive treatment of his father after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.",

Ambassador Liu Xiaoming defended the new law against accusations it erodes Hong Kong’s autonomy. Liu pointed out that the U.K. handed control of the city that was a British colony for more than a century back to Beijing in 1997 and said the citizenship offer “constitutes a gross interference in China’s internal affairs.' Johnson introduced a new visa and citizenship route for certain Hong Kong residents last week after deciding China had committed a “clear and serious breach” of the handover agreement. ",

A bumper crop of acorns last fall meant there was still plenty of food on the ground when the chipmunks emerged from winter and got busy breeding this spring, People needn’t get too alarmed over the bumper crop of chipmunks because small mammal populations are prone to boom-and-bust cycles.",

The ship operator Hurtigruten says it is stopping all cruises with its three vessels.  Authorities are worried that the virus may spread further, however, because the ship often acts like a ferry, transporting people and cargo from port to port along Norway’s picturesque coast. In response, Norway banned cruise ships from docking for two weeks.",

The book by New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt says “word went out” at the White House for Vice President Mike Pence to stand by to temporarily assume presidential powers if Trump needed a medical procedure that would require him to be put under anesthesia. The White House has said the visit was part of Trump's annual physical and that he was getting a head start because he'd be busy this year campaigning. Dr. Sean Conley, Trump’s White House doctor, said Tuesday Trump remains healthy and able to perform the duties of his office. ",

It found antibodies lasted for at least four months after diagnosis. Independent experts say if a vaccine can spur production of long-lasting antibodies like that, it gives hope that immunity may not be fleeting as some smaller studies previously suggested.",

At some, organizers are stringing up shower curtains to separate people. ",

Current testing methods can tell when a person has been infected with coronavirus, when their immune system kicks in, and when the virus is cleared. But there's no test to tell, definitely, when someone is no longer contagious. Guidelines recommend staying in isolation for at least 10 days after experiencing COVID-10 symptoms and to be without a fever for at least 24 hours. Trump's doctor said the president will reach day 10 on Saturday and can then return to public events.",

Among most social mammals — such as gorillas, lions, wolves and humans — offspring of at least one gender leave their parents’ group to find mates and join other families. In the few species like mongooses where this isn’t the case, other strategies are needed to avoid inbreeding. The new research, based on 19 years of behavioral and demographic data, was published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",

Tourists from either city must take nucleic acid tests before their flight, after arrival and before their return to prove they do not have the virus. They will have to take designated flights that will carry only passengers travelling within the bubble, with a maximum of 200 travelers.

Over 2,000 pensioners were estimated to have marched down a central avenue in Minsk in what has turned into a regular Monday rally. Mass protests gripped Belarus since official results from the Aug. 9 presidential election gave President Alexander Lukashenko a victory over his widely popular opponent Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. She and her supporters refused to recognize the result, saying it was manipulated. Authorities have cracked down hard on the largely peaceful demonstrations. Thousands have been detained and human rights advocates say many of them have been beaten since the election. ",

The virus spreads mainly through the respiratory droplets people spray when talking, coughing or sneezing. It’s why health experts stress the importance of wearing masks and social distancing.

Early studies finding it could linger on surfaces for days were also conducted under laboratory conditions. So if you have good hand washing practices, experts say wiping down groceries isn't necessary for most. ",

The airline, which was formed 25 years ago, has apologized to its passengers for the sudden termination of all flights and thanked them for “the years of trust, travel and friendship.” The company, which operated a small fleet and flew to many European capitals, is estimated to have accumulated more than 150 million of euros in debt, which grew further with the collapse of the summer tourist season because of the coronavirus pandemic.",

    "text": "Hundreds of migrants are freezing and stranded in a squalid, burnt-out tent camp in Bosnia as heavy snow fell and winter temperatures dropped. Migrants at the Lipa camp on Saturday wrapped themselves in blankets to protect against biting winds in northwest Bosnia bordering European Union member Croatia. A fire earlier this week engulfed the camp near the town of Bihac that already was harshly criticized by aid groups as inadequate for housing migrants. Authorities have failed to find new accommodation for the migrants, leaving them stranded in the cold. One man shouted that animals were treated better than the migrants in Bosnia. ",

For health care workers who have been battling the virus with only masks and shields to protect them, the vaccines represented an emotional relief as well as a very public chance to urge others to follow suit. Europe has seen over 336,000 deaths in the pandemic and is still being hard hit by the latest surge of infections and deaths.",

In so many ways, 2020's pandemic-induced isolation just threw our dependence on technology into overdrive. But for all the winners — like Zoom, e-commerce and video games — there were plenty of losers, too. Virtual reality sounded like a good escape, but it never took off. Quibi fizzled and Uber and Lyft saw their ridership plummet. As for Big Tech? Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google did well financially. But regulators are breathing down their neck. ",

Russia's main investigative agency said Tuesday that it has opened a criminal case against Navalny on charges of large-scale fraud related to his alleged mishandling of some $5 million in private donations to his Anti-Corruption Foundation and other organizations. Navalny is in Germany convalescing from an August poisoning with a Soviet-era nerve agent. He ridiculed the new accusations as a sign of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “hysterics.”Navalny has accused Putin of ordering his poisoning,. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the accusation. ",

The company said the hackers were able to view some of the code underlying Microsoft software, but weren’t able to make any changes to it. Microsoft said its defense plans assumed that hackers could see its code and that it found no evidence of hacker access to customer data or any indications that its systems were used to attack others.",
