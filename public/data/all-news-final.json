Clyburn made his announcement Wednesday, a day after Democratic presidential candidates debated in the state. Front-runner Bernie Sanders spoke at an Al Sharpton breakfast. And Pete Buttigieg, a leading critic of both Biden and Sanders, canceled multiple events saying he was sick. The developments came just three days before South Carolina's presidential primary election — and six days before Super Tuesday — with the Democratic establishment growing increasingly concerned that Sanders, a polarizing progressive, is tightening his grip on his party's nomination. ",

Not much ice wine gets made even in a good year but the wines fetch high prices. Freezing the grapes before they are crushed creates an intensely sweet, golden wine often served with dessert.",

It’s also become a way for those of us who are cooped up, isolated and anxious to reduce pain and isolation, show support for the homeless, let out anger and frustration, and even let children yowl back and forth with the friends they can’t play with. ",

A total of 108 people were killed and 178 were hurt. Investigators found that nearly half of the attackers had used guns they possessed illegally, and about two-thirds of the people suspected of committing the mass attacks had exhibited behavior that was concerning to others. ",

Experts say in-person education would be too risky in areas where the virus is poorly controlled. Elsewhere, they say schools still need to take steps to minimize risk when reopening. Recommended measures include wearing face coverings in schools and limiting movement so kids stay in the same classroom all day. But given the many lingering unknowns about the virus, school districts are approaching the school year in a variety of ways. ",

Demand for toilet paper was so high during the pandemic, that to keep their shelves stocked, retailers across the country had to buy up foreign brands, mostly from Mexico. A CVS in New York was selling three Mexican toilet paper brands: Regio, Hoteles Elite and Daisy Soft. Mexico's Petalo was on the shelves of a Piggly Wiggly in Sister Bay, Wisconsin. And a Safeway in Fremont, California, had several of those brands, plus Vogue, whose label said in Spanish that it smells like chamomile. The stores said they needed to get creative during the pandemic as people hoarded toilet paper.",

    "text": "The new director of Idaho National Laboratory said its efforts to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by creating a new generation of nuclear reactors appears to align with the goals of the incoming Biden adminstration and will likely receive ongoing bipartisan support. The U.S. is currently involved in a massive effort to revamp the nation’s fading nuclear power industry by developing safer fuel and power plants. Incoming Director John Wagner says Idaho National Laboratory is a key component in that plan. The U.S. gets about 20% of its energy from nuclear power produced at nearly 100 nuclear plants. But many are having a tough time competing economically. ",

    "text": "Companies are testing drugs that mimic the way the body fights COVID-19, hoping they can fill a key gap as vaccines remain months off for most people. The drugs supply antibodies, substances the immune system makes to block the virus from infecting cells. These are some of the most complex medicines that exist. Unlike chemicals simply mixed in a lab, antibodies are coaxed from living cells and grown in a tedious, high-tech process. Each drug is developed from a single coronavirus survivor. One company tested more than 3,300 antibodies before choosing two for its drug, which has gone into the arm of a U.S. president and others fighting COVID-19.",

    "text": "German doctors treating Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny after he was poisoned with a nerve agent have detailed the case in The Lancet medical journal. Berlin’s Charite hospital said Wednesday that Navalny had given his permission for that. Navalny fell ill suddenly on a domestic flight in Russia on Aug. 20. Following an emergency landing and treatment at a hospital in Omsk, Navalny was flown to Berlin on a private air ambulance on Aug. 22. The European Union imposed sanctions on six Russian officials and a state research institute after tests by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons established that Navalny had been exposed to the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok. The Kremlin denies involvement in the poisoning.",

The bearers of glad tidings are the so-called “grandchildren of Santa Claus,” families and individuals who answered an Italian charity’s call to spread cheer to elderly care home residents who may live far from their loved ones or don’t have any left. After a grim year marked by death and loneliness, residents of the Martino Zanchi Foundation nursing home received virtual visits and gifts from their volunteer grandchildren.   One volunteer said she had lost both her grandparents this year “but I still wanted to be a grandchild.”",

    "text": "Experts say the COVID-19 pandemic has helped revive the autopsy at many hospitals. The procedure has helped doctors this year understand what coronavirus does to patients’ organs and how they might better treat some of the disease’s more baffling symptoms. At the same time, hospital autopsies remain far less common and much more under-resourced than they were 50 years ago. By demonstrating how a hospital’s morgue can help improve care in its ICUs, experts hope the pandemic could lead to something of a renaissance for the practice. Others are less certain about whether autopsies can fully rebound.",

It has prompted an Indiana hospital system to promise a “full external review.” According to her Facebook post, Dr. Susan Moore tested positive for COVID-19 in late November and was hospitalized in suburban Indianapolis. The physician said she had to repeatedly ask for medication, scans and routine checks while admitted. She noted a white doctor in particular who seemingly dismissed her pain. She was sent home but was hospitalized again. Her condition deteriorated, and she died Dec. 20.   ",

The airline, which was formed 25 years ago, has apologized to its passengers for the sudden termination of all flights and thanked them for “the years of trust, travel and friendship.” The company, which operated a small fleet and flew to many European capitals, is estimated to have accumulated more than 150 million of euros in debt, which grew further with the collapse of the summer tourist season because of the coronavirus pandemic.",

The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction says condemned killer Romell Broom died Monday at age 64. Department spokesperson Sara French says Broom is on the agency's “COVID probable list” for inmates suspected to have died of COVID-19 pending a death certificate. The 2009 execution of Broom by lethal injection was called off after two hours when Ohio prison technicians were unable to find a suitable vein. Broom cried in pain while receiving 18 needle sticks. ",
