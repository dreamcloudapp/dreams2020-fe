1,,1/1/2020,"“Scavengers” The most meaningful picture from my dream is that everything was burnt. It was like a post after the fire burning of the world. Yet even though there was cooled lava stone kind of shell overtop everything that was alive, there were still some people left. So some people had survived. And some people had scavenged stuff from the rubble or had hammered the crust with something and broken off a piece of some piece of junk - like an item you’d normally buy in a store, that kind of junk - and had scrabbled a living from this. The people that had done that were emaciated and skinny like skeletons with vacant eyes. Their whole focus was on what they had scavenged and made into a business to sell. They weren’t chasing me and I wasn’t running from them. Because I was uninterested in their scavenged things, it was like they didn’t even notice I was there. So I was able to be invisible. At one point in the dream, one of them looked at me and I still remember that hollow kind of hungry gaze and it pierced me for a second, and then I think because I didn’t return it, I didn’t need it - I didn’t need anything it had, its hunger just retracted and then it was as though I was insignificant and it left me alone. They were quite frightening to look at, so was what they had - it was like things you get from the dump, but there were people that were buying it and it was so awful.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,24/12/2019
2,,2/1/2020,"I had three dreams this week. The details are blurred. All of the dreams were Apocalyptic. The world was already burned. I’m surviving it. There’s a few other people that have survived it. The last one was really hot and dry. To be honest, I was in the dream, I was dreaming it and it was so hot and dry that I felt like I couldn’t breathe. I woke myself up and out of the dream.",Dreamer 3,Freya,environment,6/1/2020
3,,3/1/2020,"“The Attacks” My dream last night was a nightmare. It starts in the town where I grew up. I’m in front of the house that I lived in when I was growing up. I’m sitting on the grass in the front lawn and I see a person but it’s not clearly identified features. I’m just somehow in my dream saying it’s a man. The man is running and shouting angrily. I feel threatened so I start to back up. The person runs into my neighbor’s house on the right. I can’t go in my own house because I'm not safe there so I sneak around the side of my house and am hiding in the backyard. I hear screaming and yelling and commotion. The man comes out of my neighbor’s house and starts coming back up towards my house and goes in - nothing happens because no one’s in there - and comes out. I realize that he is sneaking or stalking around the perimeter of my own house. So I avoid him but he’s not far behind and I don’t know where to go that’s safe. I notice that my other neighbor’s side door is open a little bit and I’m feeling kind of bad about going into the house without knocking, but if I don’t run in and close the door and lock it, then that thing will get me. So I run in, close the door and lock it and the lady that owns the house looks at me and says, “Oh! What are you doing in here?” I say, “Quick! Lock the front door! There’s an angry person!” (but I don’t call it that in the dream. I’ve given it a name and the name escapes me). I warn her, so she does and we listen and it’s yelling angrily and pounding at the door and trying to get in, but it doesn’t. But while it’s trying, I tell her that it’s been chasing me for ages and I’m really sorry for invading your privacy, but I needed to come in here or it would kill me. She says that’s okay, it’s alright. She calmly looks at me and says, “Freya, what have you been doing? I never see you anymore.” So she’s talking to me and she’s kind of oblivious that this thing is out there. And then our small talk finishes. It’s quiet. It’s been quiet. I hover by the inside of her side door, waiting and waiting. I finally decide to open the door a crack, take a peek out, look around, there’s nothing. So I decide to leave and I go out of her house. I start walking up the street. Just as I get part way up, there it is again! It’s chasing me again, so I’m running and I can feel my breath getting caught in my throat and I’m getting out of breath and my legs start to hurt but I keep running and running and running. All of a sudden, that town turns into the town where I currently live. I’m coming towards the main street and I don’t know where to go because it’s dark out, nothing’s open, I don’t know anyone there. Then I realize that my friend lives about a block away and I might be able to make it to his house. So I do. This thing is behind me! I can hear it and it’s like just almost within a grasp of me the whole time. I make it to my friend’s apartment building and again I’m feeling the same kind of thing as I did in my neighbor’s house where I don’t feel right about barging in without knocking or without asking if it’s okay to come over or any of those things you do before you go over to someone else’s house. His door is slightly ajar and I run in, close the door and do up all the locks. I’m standing there and I can hear this thing on the outside, and it’s like snuffling around almost animal-like. I can feel its fingers tracing the outline of the door, looking for some way to come in. I back away really really slowly. I see my friend lying on the couch in his living room. He’s resigin. He’s having a nap. So I quietly sneak down into one of the bedrooms. I sit there. Some time passes and I’m listening for this thing and now I can hear it outside the apartment building trying to find a different way in. I don’t look out the window because I’m afraid it will see me. And then my friend wakes up and he’s over by the bedroom door, and I’m like shh with my finger over my mouth. I indicate to go to the middle of the apartment. The kitchen is actually in the middle. We go over there and I tell him, “I hope you don’t mind me coming in. There’s this thing chasing me and everywhere I go, it manages to break in the door or smash a window.” He says, “Oh, that’s okay.” So he tells me to just make myself comfortable and I do. He, my friend, goes about his regular tasks. He’s putting his things in his case and collecting up textbooks and he’s packing his lunch. He gets dressed and I’m still sitting there waiting and waiting. I’m nervous that he’s going to open the door and that thing will get in and find me. But he tells me to lock the door behind him, he opens the door, there’s nothing there. He goes to work and then I lock the doors behind him. So now I’m sitting in his apartment. I don’t have any of my own stuff. There’s not really anything to do. So I go in and wash the dishes because there’s nothing else to do. Then I’m sitting in the living room staring at the walls, feeling slightly trapped. I’m not calm. I can feel how tense and wired my body is. Then I sense that there’s somebody in one of the back bedrooms. So I go in there and my daughter’s in there and I’m like, “Oh! You’re here!” Then I notice that my cats have appeared - they are in the apartment too. I go into the other room and there’s my son. So now everybody’s in here and they’re safe. Okay, this is a good thing. Now, what are we going to do about food and clothing. I go over to one of the dressars and suddenly there’s clothing for us in one of the dressars. I go out to the kitchen and there’s no shortage of food - why would there be, somebody lives there. So I prepare my kids something to eat. I’m warning them, though, not to make too much noise or turn on many lights because that thing might get us. Then the day passes. We have some idle chit chat, patting the cats, and just kind of mindlessly arranging the furniture so we’ll fit in there - just slightly small. And then my friend comes back home from work and he’s just in there. I don’t actually see him come in the door, so there’s no fear about the door - that’s not revisited. He’s just in there again and I still feel tense that now we’re wearing different clothes and we’ve made food and now my cats and my kids are in there. And I’m scared because this is a huge invasion of his privacy. I don’t know where his dog went - he actually has a dog that would be some concern with the cats, but the dog doesn’t seem to be there. He’s a single dad and his two kids - the one son just comes and goes freely and the daughter is two weeks on, two weeks off. So I'm tense about this and he says, no that’s fine, don’t worry about it, and he says, come here, and he gives me a big hug and says, lie down. And he’s just hugging me. I can feel myself start to relax. I feel the tension slide away from my body. I accept that I’m safe. It happens gradually - as this hug is happening, a day passes and a night passes and a day passes and a night passes, and then I accept that okay, this is the right place to hide and it’s okay. My daughter has started to come and go freely. My son hasn’t. My friend’s kids are in their own routine and they get along fine. My son has taken an interest in his daughter - she is unique - and my son is very nurturing. The two of them have formed some kind of bond and that doesn’t surprise me because my son loves younger kids. So some semblance of normalcy has formed in my environment. I still want to go home, but I know I can’t and for now, this is working fine and people are happy.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,14/1/2020
4,,4/1/2020,"“The Sandbox'' In this odd mix of imagery and people, I find myself in a large two-story house with various people that I know from my extended family and where I currently work. The dream begins with C.R. from work and she’s been given the responsibility of taking care of two babies - one is about 10 months, almost ready to walk but not ready walking independently, and one can’t be anymore than 9 months older, not even two and he’s male. Later on in the dream when I ask what the children’s names are, someone tells me that the younger one is named Stacey and the older one is Alexander. So she’s taking care of them and I see her bring the babies out of a room and wonder if maybe they’ve just been bathed because they’re naked. She lays the younger one down on the rug beside the railing. The older one is standing. She tells them to stay there while she goes into a different room and gets diapers. I’m coming out of another room and I see them there and think, “Why is she laying them there? It’s really close to the stairs.” I’m thinking that the younger one can roll and fall down the stairs. I start to move towards that child and at the same time, she rolls and goes all the way down the stairs face first! I’m just horrified and thinking, “Oh my god!” She lands at the bottom and C.R. comes out of the room carrying the diapers, picks her up, and she’s okay! She carries her back upstairs and says, “Here can you hold her?” So, I do. I’m standing there with a naked baby on my hip. I’m looking at her and thinking, “Don’t you pee on me!” And that’s when I ask, “Whose children are these and what are their names?” Someone comes up to me and says the younger one is Stacey, the older one is Alexander. They belong to someone, but the name is muffled so I can’t understand what it is. That person isn’t there right now. Now the scenery that evolves around me is a kitchen. I’m standing there and there's people at the table. I see my stepmom’s brother and sister-in-law who’ve been very kind to me throughout my life. My aunt has a natal wheel in her hand and she says to me (I’m still holding this kid on my hip), “Is it possible that each year on my birthday, the aspects will move into a different house?” I reply to her and say, “Yes, because they move one degree ahead each year. I say, “So if you have any aspects that are in the 29th degree of something last year, then this year, they’ll be at the 30th degree, so it’s on the cusp. Or if they were on the 30th last year they’ll be in the first degree the next one, so they’ll be all the way in a different house. What have you got there?” She shows me her natal wheel and I say, “Oh look, you’ve got something that’s just moved into this house, which is ruled by Libra.” So she’s studying her chart and she’s absorbed by this. Then the kitchen suddenly expands and there’s a long dining room like my grandparents used to have. There’s a long table that seats 14 or 18 people and it’s set for dinner and there's chairs and whatnot. People start carrying dishes that they’ve prepared in the kitchen and they’re setting them out on the table. I’m vaguely aware that this is my extended family and the gathering is because it’s my aunt’s birthday. But at the same time, the children have been picked up by whoever owns them and I’m no longer carrying the one on my hip. Then, there’s this wooden small sandbox beside me. It’s a square box and made of plywood. It has a divider in it in the middle that divides the sandbox into 4 equal parts filled with sand. Another friend that I’ve recently starting talking to more from the studio where I teach, Arizona, is walking up that same hallway where those two kids were laying and the one fell down the stairs. He sees me and comes up and says, “What do you think about the election?” I say, “Just like this sandbox here, we have the same people in the same demographics and no matter who is running, the outcome is going to be the same because the sand hasn’t changed from its compartments.” He says to me, “I think you’re wrong and I’ll tell you why.” By this time, he’s walked all the way up the hallway and is now standing beside me in the kitchen. I say, “Why? What do you think?” I’m really curious and given the political climate we live in, I’m obviously really hopeful because I would like for it to change. I don’t want the same person to be elected - he’s a Trump kind of person, but he’s not called Trump in the dream. So he starts talking to me and I can’t hear what he’s saying and I really want to hear him. He’s tilting his head to the side and I’m tilting my head to the side so I can still hear him and all of a sudden we’re lying down in a bed and I’m leaning in to hear what he’s saying the way you would lean into kiss someone, but the other person’s mouth is by your ear. Then I take my leg and wrap it over top him. His hands are around my low back and he flips me over, so I’m on my back but his hands are still behind me and he starts stroking underneath my buttocks and around my yoni from behind. It sends a rush of pleasure all the way up my spine and it was so pronounced that I woke up. I never got to hear what he thought about the election.",Dreamer 3,Freya,election,12/2/2020
5,,5/1/2020,"“The Concert” The setting of this dream is the house I used to live in in Toronto. It starts and I’m in the kitchen with many other people. I had three roommates in this house, sometimes 4. It was close to UFT. Most of us were students, though some were not. I don’t know everybody in the kitchen this particular day, though I do know some of them. Everything in this dream is long and slow motion and drawn out and stretched in terms of the background. It’s not that people are moving in slow motion, but the minutes between things are elongated and stretched. I woke up feeling really heavy and groggy. In the kitchen, someone is making toast and the toaster is way across the kitchen. While the toast is in the toaster and I’m waiting for my turn, there’s at least 7 people that come in and out of the kitchen and have conversations, then leave the kitchen again, and the toast is still in the toaster. It’s not burnt, though. I can see the elements are still on, but it’s taking ages to toast yet the relationships among people are moving at a normal speed. I don’t question this in the dream - it’s not until I wake up that I notice everything in the dream is taking longer. In the kitchen, I’m oblivious of this distortion of time. I do, however, have these conversations with people. When I realize I’m not going to have toast that day, I leave the kitchen and go upstairs to my room. I go through the drawers in my room, looking to see what's there because a concert is happening tonight and Omar is meeting me at my house along with a couple of other friends. I start to prepare and I’m deciding what to wear. In one of the drawers, I find a bunch of checks. I look at it and wonder where these came from. When I start to look through it, I realize these are checks that a whole bunch of people have given me. They are of various amounts for an endeavor I’m supposed to be taking. They have invested in me. I realize I haven’t put them in the bank and they aren’t very safe where they are rolled up and put in this ceramic vase. So it sparks my memories. I put them back in the vase. It’s too late to go to the bank tonight, but I will go tomorrow. Then I go back downstairs. Omar and his friend Al and a girl he’s taking with him have arrived and they’re in the living room. We are happy to see each other. I go down and am talking to them for a while. I see what he’s wearing and tell him I’m going to get changed. I go back upstairs and someone is in the shower. I find a rolled up wad of money on the floor. I turn around and Omar is behind me. I say, “Is this yours?” He says, “No. Oh, there’s so many people in this house and we don’t know all of them. Don’t go downstairs and just say, ‘whose wad of money is this?’” I say, “I won’t. I’m going to go put it in my room and I’ll find a way to make it known to someone so they know their money is missing.” I go back into my room and I change. I pick out a black mini skirt with gold thread around the hem. I think it’s very pretty and sparkly. I choose a white blouse and a jacket that goes overtop just a few inches above the hem of the skirt. I put on my black tights and a pair of bulky socks and boots that look really nice. Then I go downstairs and Omar tells me I look very nice. But I turn and Al’s friend (I don’t know her name) is wearing the same thing I am. I think, “Well that’s really odd. That wasn’t what she was wearing when I went up the stairs.” I look over at Omar and he’s laughing. I shrug it off and I say to everyone in the room, “How much money is everyone bringing?” So I’m trying to get them to look in their wallets. The person whose money it is that’s missing will realize it’s lost and I can return the money to whoever it is. But they all check their wallets and they say different amounts. I say, “Okay, well I’m going to go upstairs and get my money.” While I’m going upstairs, the person is still in the shower and I realize it’s my nephew, Jared. I wonder if the money belongs to him. I put the wad of money in the same ceramic vase as the other checks that I need to deposit in the bank. Then I look through my own drawers and I find my wallet. I take out 2 twenties and put them in the little clutch that I’ve decided to take with me for the night. I go back downstairs again. Someone else is in the living room and she’s showing Omar this fabric and saying, “Isn’t this beautiful? It would make a nice skirt.” I look and say, “Oh yes, it is.” This is all gold and if you look closely, the gold thread has created patterns of flowers and it’s shimmering. This gold is really quite beautiful. Then suddenly, it’s not fabric anymore. It is a skirt - a longer skirt. She says, “This skirt costs $2,000 and people pay that for it and only wear it once. Within a couple of weeks it’s in a punk rock thrift store and that’s where I found it. This would look really nice on you.” I say, “Wow, you’re giving it to me?!” She says, “Yes.” I say, “Thank you so much!” I was thinking maybe I’ll change into it for tonight and then decide not to because it’s a long skirt and I want to save it for another time. I ask her if she would like some money for it. She hesitates and doesn’t answer and I’m thinking I could give her another twenty. I’m waiting and waiting, but she doesn’t answer me, so I thank her graciously. I go back upstairs and I put it in my room. I look into my wallet and I get out another $20 just in case to give to her. So I go back downstairs and by this time, I’m becoming conscious that it feels like it's the same time and all these activities are happening and we still haven’t left for the concert. So I say to everyone, “Shouldn’t we be leaving?” They say, “Yes, it starts really soon.” I look out the door and I see that someone else is coming in and they need to get ready for the concert. Right at that time, there’s a sliver in the time-space continuum and I’m at work. I’m thinking, “I need to get back to meet everyone for the concert.” Then when I'm thinking that, that same time frame fabric opens up and I’m back in the house. I think, “Oh good, everyone is still here.” But then we’re waiting for someone else to get ready. She comes back downstairs and she’s wearing that shimmering gold skirt. I think, “Wow, this is really odd.” But again I just shrug it off and I’m trying to get everyone to go. I say, “We should call for a cab.” But Omar’s friend is driving. I tell them there isn’t enough room for everyone in the one car. Then suddenly they have other rides and we get in the car and go. We arrive at the concert hall and I’m surprised that it’s general admission. We find a place to stand on the floor. I feel like I’m in the masonic temple or the music hall. I decide it’s the music hall. It’s quite dark. The band is playing but there’s no lights on the stage or upstairs on the balcony. But I recognize the structure and I think, “Oh I know where we are.” Then we start dancing as though the concert is just a background. It’s good. Omar and I are dancing and enjoying ourselves. That’s when I wake up.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,6/3/2020
6,,6/1/2020,"This dream starts in a house where I am getting ready to go on a journey. The journey begins at a certain time for me. But as I’m starting to pack, I realize my daughter is also coming with me. There’s other people in the house besides my daughter. They seem to be part of the background, like white noise, although occasionally one will come up and make some kind of remark or offer some bit of direction or advice. I’m packing bags. There’s a reason, although I don’t know what, that my daughter has to leave 10 minutes before I do and I’m going to meet her there. I pack both of our bags separately and I make two different lunches - one for her, one for me. As I go to leave out the apartment door, one of the people that lives there, comes up. Although she does not look like my step-mother, she carries the energy of her and the dynamic between us is the same. She questions me and says, “Are you sure you should be doing that?” I tell her, “It’s fine, I have to do this anyway.” Then I close the door. Although I do not see how I get to the train station, we suddenly shift from my apartment to the train station. I am standing there to purchase her train ticket and the conductor or ticket seller says to me: “How old is that child?” I look down in puzzlement and see that she’s only five. I think, “How did that happen? My daughter is much older than that.” I see her as older but having a 5-year old body. I think, “Well, I can’t send a 5-year-old by themselves on this 3-hour train ride to a different country. It’s not safe.” So, I tell him I’ve changed my mind. Then I’m uncertain what to do. Now I’m in a dilemma. I sit outside the train station for a moment with her. I start talking to her and describing the country we’re about to go to. I tell her that it’s Rome and describe the kind of life we would have there. She’s enjoying the story. But now I have to figure out how I’m going to get us there at the same time. In that moment, the dream shifts. I'm not at the train station anymore. My daughter and I are at this old beautiful house. It’s one of the houses that a governor general would have been given to build when they first came over from Britain or France to what would have been Upper or Lower Canada. We enter this house and are greeted by a butler who indicates where we are to put our shoes and socks. The house has extremely high ceilings and an extraordinary amount of washrooms. So as we walk down the main hallway, there’s one washroom to the left - it’s like a powder room. Across the wide hallway is a bathroom with a bathtub, bidet, marbled sink and scale and lots of white fluffy Egyptian cotton towels. The door is open, that's how I can see this. We continue down the main hallway to a gathering room, like a lounge area. There’s many people there. One of them is a person I know. The other people I recognize as people affiliated with the house - the family that owns the house and people that work for that family. We take a seat on one of the couches. More people keep coming in during this period of time when we’re waiting. We end up being a little bit squished - where you can feel the arm of the person sitting beside you on these couches. I’m able to hear the one person I know - he’s an author - that he’s actually voice-to-text recording an idea for a story as he’s sitting here waiting for the gathering. So we’re sitting in this sitting room, waiting, and I’m listening to the author voice-to-app recording some kind of idea. I’m getting the feeling that there’s some kind of clandestine activity going on. The people that have filed in and don’t have anywhere to sit and are standing close to me - there’s two of them - they’re also talking in hushed tones. I’m starting to sink into my body a little and extend my hearing out, so I'm focusing in on these individual conversations that people are having. In the dream, I am still aware of the purpose that I’ve come to this house for and it’s tied to me being able to leave at the same time from the train station with my daughter. I also start to realize that what the man is recording isn’t just an idea for a book, it’s a plan for also getting out of this country and into another one. I start listening to it more. Then he realizes I am listening and says, “Do you recognize that?” I said yes. He says, “After this is over, meet me in the bathroom - the main bathroom in the main hallway.” So I agree. Then someone comes in that’s a representative from this family. I start to notice that all of the family - they have pale whitish gold skin and bright red hair. As I look at the man beside me, I notice that he’s got some kind of similarity of features and coloring even though his hair is a lot darker, it has some threads of red-gold in it. I wonder if he’s a member of the family and disgruntled somehow with how they normally do things and that’s why he’s planning this way to get out that’s in opposition to what the family is telling us. Then in the dream, I have this flashback memory of being on a ski hill a long time ago and seeing them all together and that’s where I also know him from. Then in the room, the representative of the family is telling us this stuff. I’m not really listening. I’m starting to watch the people who are circulating around the room and gathering together - like who’s sitting with who and stuff. I see one person go up the stairs into the upstairs bathroom that’s at the top of the stairs. About two minutes later, I see the person they were talking to also go up the stairs into that bathroom. I’m thinking, “What are they up to?” So I walk up the stairs. Just as I arrive at the top, the one person exits. The door is open and the other person is standing there. I look in and the bathroom is hideous. It’s got toilet paper strewn all over the place and it looks like it hasn’t been cleaned in ages. The toilet itself is like a portapotty, only about six inches off the ground and the seat looks like it was made for a toddler, yet it looks like adults have been urinating into it, so there’s urine all over the seat and it’s just hideous. In fact, it does look like the last person stood on it and squatted and that’s why there’s urine all over it. There’s no conversation going on. I turn around and go back down the stairs. I realize that the meeting conversation is over and people are starting to disassemble. I go through the sitting room. Now I have my daughter in hand, she’s still five and as I’m leaving, I look to the side and I see the man that I’ve been talking to and he’s in the main bathroom where he asked to meet. But the door is open a crack and he has a towel wrapped around his waist, his hair is wet and he’s drying it with another towel. He’s just had a shower. So he’s involved in what he’s doing. There’s no meeting going on. He appears not to recognize me. That was just all at a glance. So I just keep walking out the front door with my daughter. I walk out the front door and we are back at the train station again. I’ve got these two lunches in my hand still and our suitcases. The train rolls up. We both get on it. We sit in one of the compartments and open up our lunches. I describe to her what I’ve made for her. We start eating. The train starts moving. And that’s where I wake up.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,15/3/2020
7,,7/1/2020,"“COVID Anxiety Dream” The setting is my elementary school. People are getting shelter in that school, like quarantine. I am one of those people. The whole dream is inked and soaked with sinister dirty energy. It’s just horrible. There’s the feeling that something or someone is going to find us and we’re hiding. Then for some reason, people start going outside. We feel we have to. There’s not a choice. So we start walking single-file and there’s quite a few minutes between each person as they exit the building. So first I’m standing outside by myself and it’s dark, it’s nighttime. Then I can still see the lights on in the school because I’m standing in the schoolyard. Then a few minutes later, someone else comes out of the building and a few minutes later someone else comes out. There are about five people. Then from around the other side of the building come two people. One of them is viciously stabbing the other person. There’s blood everywhere. While the attacker is occupied with the stabbing, the people that I’m standing there with are like, “Where are we going to go? We have to go somewhere where we’re not in danger from this person.” Then we walk around to the other side of the building and there’s a tuck shop on the lawn. We’re hiding around one side of the tuck shop which is closed. Then the attacker that was stabbing is covered with blood and is walking through the crowd because more people have come to gather around the tuck shop. They’re standing social distance apart. No one is standing close together. No one is huddled. So it’s not even really a group. There are about twelve people and we know that he might stab each one of us, but he’s not coming close enough.

8,,8/1/2020,"“Wooden Ship” In this dream I'm on a really big, long ship made entirely of wood. It’s between 40 and 60 feet long. It’s shaped like an arc or one of the older viking style ships. The ship belongs to my friend Randy from high school. He is captioning it and he’s invited me to go out on the ship for a day. The wood is really old - it’s dry and cracked from the sun, there's no luster in it or polish on the outside. In order to make it sea-worthy, there's this thick almost hemp-like woven netting about 5 inches thick and tight weave that cascades down from the gunnels to the hull. It’s not on the bottom of the hull, it just goes way past the draft all the way down to the bottom. It’s got debris filtered from the water as it’s gone through. So there's no spaces between the weaves, between the organic debris and the tightness of it. There’s a ladder to climb up the side and it swings a bit with your body weight as you climb. So I climb up, wrap my leg over the top, hop down and I’m standing on the deck. Randy follows me and takes the wheel. We start moving. I can feel the sway of the ship on top of the water and am starting to enjoy the splashes that come up over the sides. The channel where we are is relatively busy. We haven’t gone all the way out into the body of water. We’re still going through the channel. I’m standing on the bow, leaning over, and I see rock - like a shelf of rock underneath the surface of the water. So I shout back to him: “Randy, it’s too shallow here, we’ll never make it through! We’re going to run aground!” He says, “No, no, we’ll be fine. I’ve done this before.” He’s maneuvering the ship and I’m positive it’s going to scrape because it looks like the rock shelf is only about 12 inches under the water and you’re going to scrape your keel. You’re going to get stuck there. The ship is still going over it. We maneuver over quite a few of these and come out into the open water where you don’t need to man the ship so closely. So I walk from the bow back into the cockpit and I say, “I can’t believe the ship just didn't run aground.” He says, “That’s because it has no keel.” And I’m like, “What?! So how are we staying balanced?” Then just at the same time, I notice there really is a lot of side to side sway of the ship, like it’s rocking and a little bit forward. I say, “Oh, that explains that.” The dream speeds through the day on the water like it’s just a minute and we’re coming back through this same channel. Now it’s time to tie up. I’m getting the lines ready. In order to tie up in this one place, I also have to climb up a ladder that’s on the inside of the boat at starboard. As I’m climbing up, I realize it’s not attached to the wall and it’s like 12 feet up. This ship is big. So I start to climb and I have to be really careful where I put my feet and balance so that the pitching of the boat with no keel doesn’t pitch me off with the ladder away from the sides. So I’m trying to counter this. I make it up to the top. Then I have to walk across the top of it. Now it’s a platform, like walking the plank. It’s only about 6 inches wide and before I get to the end, Randy comes up the other side. He’s a lot heavier than me and it unbalances me. The top of the plank comes up like a seesaw. But I jump down with the line and I’m okay. Now I’m trying to tie the boat up. He makes it over the side, too. I’m standing there talking to him saying, “How is this boat balanced without a keel?” He tips the whole boat in the water so I can see - it’s made of wood so it must be light plus it’s buoyant. There’s actually a hole, like a long skinny hole in the bottom. I can see where this fibrous netting has ended and the space at the bottom of the hull where the keel used to be. It’s actually a hole. I’m kind of nonplussed, thinking how the ship doesn’t leak and how does it work? Then I wake up.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,19/3/2020
9,,9/1/2020,"“The Cyborg in Me” I entered my dream space as a cyborg. There was no one else in it. I felt nothing. There were no emotions as I was looking out at all different kinds of settings and landscapes, like I was passing through but didn’t belong. There were no people in it. It was all nighttime and dark and quiet. At some point, just before I woke up, that’s when I realized I was cataloging things through my eye. I started to realize there was a human part of me that realized I was cyborg. That’s when the creepy feeling started coming in about not feeling anything. Then I woke up. I couldn’t shake the creepy feeling of not having emotions. It just carried through like wiry air that was empty of something.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,25/3/2020
10,,10/1/2020,"“Dancing on the Edge” In this dream, it’s in a house that I don’t recognize - it’s not mine, I’ve never been in it. The set up is we’re all on the top floor - I don’t even know what’s in the basement. The top floor of the house as you come up the stairs at one end from the main floor is a sitting room. As you walk from that door, you go through the kitchen and you keep walking through the kitchen, you come to an eating area - dining room. Then straight ahead of the eating room are a few bedrooms. The doors are closed; we don’t see them in the dream. Off to the left is an upper floor sun room that has chairs in it and a lot of windows. The whole upstairs feels worn - the floors dip in the middle and there’s the old kind of linoleum tile that curls up at the edges of each square. The windows have a film of dust and age. The paint has dulled. The paint is chipped on the frames around the doors and you can see the wood through it. Dust has stuck to the cupboards in the kitchen and they look a little greasy. The furniture is all old and of poor quality. It’s full of people. The dream begins where I’m gathered with some people around a table in the eating area. We’ve divided up a number of tasks we have to complete. One of those persons is my yoga teacher from my teacher training. He seems to be in charge of it and is assigning tasks. Everyone is listening to him. So we’re divided up into groups of two or three people and we go down. I don’t see the stairs as we go down, but I’m just suddenly outside of the house on the sidewalk and in the street. In the dream, there’s no time devoted to the journey of going in and out of each store to pick up what we’re supposed to. I just know that we’ve done it. We’re back in the meeting place with our bags. They’re not a lot of bags. They also show signs of poor quality and age. We each only have two or three items in our bag. As we group up, it’s like a hydropole - a wooden post like that - and that’s where we’re supposed to meet. We’re supposed to return to the house all together. My teacher is there and he’s waiting for everyone to be together. As our group comes together, I notice that there’s one of those big grey steel boxes on the bottom of the hydropole. He’s got one hand on it. We’re reporting to him the items we could not find. Then he says, okay, I’ll show you where some of these can be found. He opens up the lid of the grey box and we see emergency supplies in there. There’s some medicine and all other first aid things. Then he says, “These are not to be used indiscriminately. They’re only there for emergencies.” So he closes it back up. None of us take any of them. We just know that they’re there and our anxiety, if there has been any produced by not finding everything on our list, is a little bit felt through the group like an exhale. Then we trudge back up the stairs to the top floor of the house. We take our things in. Everyone is putting them away in the various places. Then we reconvene at the kitchen table. Some other group has cooked some of the food and we eat. I’m not part of that group - I’m part of the group that goes out everyday and shops. At that point after supper, some people retire to the sun room off to the left. Others stay at the table, where we’ve got board games and cards - I stay at this table. Others have gone off into one of the bedroom doors - it’s now open, but it’s not a bedroom now. It’s turned into this other room where people are having a conversation and there’s chairs. Some are still in the kitchen sorting out what we have left for supplies. A few others, just a few, have gone into that other first room. So I play games, I play cards. The card game is slow to progress and is interrupted with conversation about the emergency supplies and whatnot. Then I hear music coming from the room that was a bedroom but has turned into a conversation room. I notice that people are dancing. I think, “Oh, that’s a really good idea. I think I need to go in there and just dance. So I do. There are about five or six people there as well as my teacher. We’re just dancing, not in couples, just more an ecstatic dance inspired by the music. Then, my teacher says something that I can’t remember. I say, “I don't think that I can dance with you. I didn't realize you were this tall.” He has walked towards me - the way people do when they’re dancing just facing each other. As he gets closer, he seems taller and taller. I think that I can’t dance with you, my head only comes up to your navel. But he leans over and says, “Yes you can, you can do it anyway.” And he puts one hand on my right shoulder, takes my left hand the way people would dance together as partners, but it’s like a polka where you go side to side, tapping your toes. I’m doing it! I’m thinking, “Oh, I can do this!” And we start to go in that pattern - to the right two, back to the left two, then you turn a quarter turn, you do it again, then you turn another quarter turn, and go in a full circle. It’s working. I say to him: “Look, if you press your big toe against the floor a little when it lands and you get a little more height, a little more bounce and it starts to feel lighter!” So we do that for a little while. It just works. Then, we stop. I think the music stops. We must have danced all the way from that front room, through the kitchen, to the back room. The music stops. We stop dancing. He starts to say something, but someone else comes in and says, “We need you over here.” So, the mood immediately sombers. We go back to the kitchen table. Everybody is gathered around and sitting still. We’re talking about the supplies and the way we’re going to ration them. That’s when I wake up.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,27/3/2020
11,,11/1/2020,"“The Monster Outside the Window” In this dream, I’m sleeping in a room on the upper floor of a house. I don’t recognize the house. It has two windows that are gabled. In front of one of the windows, entering in the room, is a closet - it is not a very big one. It has two bars on either side of it with clothes hanging on. It’s probably about 7 feet from the internal door of the closet to the window. I can see the window outside of the closet. It’s almost like the closet, if you look right at it is a closet with solid walls; but when I’m in bed, I can see what’s outside of the window - both of them at the same time. So it’s almost like the walls have color and appear to be dense, yet I can see through them. The dream starts with me going to bed and I wake up in the middle of the night. I can see there’s something terrible - something I’m afraid of - outside of the window. I’m afraid to move in my bed. I don’t go back to sleep and I stay there until the morning. The day just passes in a blur. Then I go back to bed and again, I’m trying to go to sleep, but I’m awake because I know that thing is going to come back and it’s going to be outside my window again. In fact, I start to realize that it’s always outside of the window. Then, as I’m lying in bed awake, I start to get a little bit curious about what exactly it is outside of the window. So I get out of my bed and I open the door and I peek into the closet. Nothing happens yet. So I open the door a little wider and I go a little bit more into the closet. Now I’m just standing in the closet. I can feel its presence through the window pane. I’m just standing there. As I’m standing there, my ex-husband comes into the room. He starts making noise and stuff. I say, “What are you doing in here? Please stop.” He ignores me and comes into the closet. He says, “I have to get a shirt.” I tell him to stop, “Stop doing that, you’re going to disturb it.” But he doesn’t. Then the thing starts to come closer to the window. Then I realize that my ex-husband and this thing are in some kind of tango together. I realize that it’s not actually me - I’m not involved with it. So I back out of the closet and into my room. Then, there’s some other event, but it’s like the first night of the dream where I know I get up, I don’t stay in my room, I go and do some other things… but they turn into a blur. So I’m involved in this other event. Then I come back into the room and it’s night time again. My ex-husband is gone. I feel that thing that was outside of the window is now in the closet. But since I know that it kind of belongs to my ex-husband it’s not really there to scare me, I feel less frightened about it’s unknownness. So I try to get into my bed. This is pointless. I know there’s something in the closet. So I get up and again I creep over to the closet and I open the door a crack. I’m slightly afraid of what I’m going to see, but much less than the very first night. I open it up and there’s someone sitting in there. I don’t know who it is - it’s a stranger - and it’s not talking to me. It’s just sitting there. I stand there for a little while, unsure. Do I want to interact with it? But now I’ve opened the closet door, so what am I going to do now? It stands up and it’s a man. The stranger. Then the room shifts, it deconstructs and it’s not the bedroom with the gabled windows anymore. I’m in the front hall of a house, maybe it’s the main floor of this one because I had been on the upper floor in the bedroom. Then I’m involved with this other kind of transaction. Now the front door is opening and there’s someone on the other side of the door. A barter is going on. I’ve lost the rest of the dream.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,3/4/2020
12,,12/1/2020,"“The Lecture Hall” The dream begins with me leaving the house I live in. I’m going to walk to a lecture. I have a backpack on. I’m wearing a raincoat. It’s quite a hike, but that’s not unusual for me. I like to walk. The walk takes about an hour. It’s just straight up a street, block after block, tree lined and very pretty. It’s a small town. It’s like walking up Cathedral Avenue in BC with huge trees that form an umbrella - they reach toward each other overtop. So I don’t even feel the rain. It’s raining out, but I’m not feeling it on my body or my face. I’m not getting wet. I arrive at the place where the lecture is and it’s a house. I realize that it’s the house of my professor, M.M. So, I walk up to the side and knock on the door and she answers it. The door opens out into her kitchen. She’s happy to see me, though we don’t hug. We stand about 6 feet apart, respecting social distancing. There's several other people in the kitchen and they're all in some kind of process of removing outer clothing and hanging it up on hooks. Then we go down the hall from the kitchen, into an enormous university style lecture hall where there’s theatre seats and a stage. At this point, M.M. disappears and I realize that the lecture is not on the psychology topic I thought it was on, but it’s two men who are standing there and they’re kind of counting the number of people that they have. I can overhear their conversation. They’re saying that they thought there’d be more than this. But, “this is a good turnout anyway and let’s hope we can sell it.” I think, “Oh, man, I’m not here to buy anything,” and I’m disappointed. So the two men walk down the aisle towards the stage. They don’t even mount the stage yet, when people start leaving. Then the one man stands to the side and the other one gets up and stands behind the podium and he begins to talk but doesn’t say anything. More and more people are leaving until there’s only 3 or 4 people left. Then he ceases the talk and says, “Well I guess that was a bomb.” Then I’m like, “Oh good,” because I wanted to leave, too, but there were people on either side of me and I didn’t want to make a big deal about getting them to get up so I could leave. But they were leaving, so I was glad. So now I have to get my backpack and everything again. But during this moment, there’s this crowd by the door and I see M.M. again. I go up to talk to her. She’s got a man standing fairly close to her. She says, “I’m so glad to see you. It’s been a long time. I can’t give you a hug, but I can dance with you.” So she reaches her arms out and we interlace fingers. It’s the dance where the one partner spins the other partner a half turn and your hands stay clasped with your arms over your head and then the arms straighten, you move away from each other, hands stay clasped, then the next time you go all the way in so the arms are crossed in front of you, you take a few steps forward and a few steps back, you do the half turn again so your arms become uncrossed but still stay laced at the fingers. She does this a couple of times with me. During one of the times when we’re shoulder to shoulder, I say, “It’s not okay to hug, but this is okay?” She says, “i don’t know!” Then we do the step one more time. The next time we’ve lengthened arms, she releases my fingers and steps back. She introduces me to the man, but doesn’t say his name. She just says, “this is my friend.” We give each other the shoulder distance nod in recognition. I say, “This is your house?! I’m surprised that you’ve moved.” She says, “Yes, I had to downsize and I have a tenant that lives upstairs. He’s a really nice man. Just go out onto the veranda and check it out.” So I do. I open the other door, walk up the steps, look at the door outside, look at the architecture a little bit, and come back down. I’m thinking I can’t believe this opens up into a lecture hall, but I don’t comment on the size of that. Then I just look around the kitchen a little bit, make some other comments about the design and the architecture. I’m admiring it. They’re all complimentary. Then, she says, “Well, it was nice to see you.” I say, “Yes,” and tell her I need to go before it starts raining harder. So I go back into the lecture hall. Now my coat is on a coat rack - one of the tall ones that has a hook on either side and stands like a post. I begin to arrange my things. But now I’ve got two pillows and a yoga mat that I have to roll up and arrange with the backpack. So I put my raincoat on and then I roll the yoga mat up. The yoga mat is really thick and has clips and ties on it. I roll it up tight and squeeze it so the air goes out and it rolls up into this little stick. Then I wrap the clips around it, hook them and intertwine the hooks against each other so it will stay really tight. So now that’s taken care of. I put it on the bottom of my backpack. Then I put my raincoat on and think, “What am I going to do with these two pillows?” Now, I’ve got two raincoats. So the second raincoat - I fold the arms up and the hood down and I roll it up really tight and I squeeze the air out of it. I manage to get that in my backpack. Now I’ve got these two pillows. I think, how am I going to do this? They won’t fit in the backpack. I don't want to carry them. I don’t want them to get wet because they’re down-filled. So I put one against my back and then it takes me ages to reach my arm around to find the loop of the backpack. While I’m doing this, the two men that were to have the presentation are starting to gather their things up, too. The one comments to me: “Sure is taking you a long time to get your stuff on.” I don’t answer him. I just continue getting my stuff on because I think he’s just stated the obvious and it doesn’t require a reply. Then I finally find the second loop to my backpack - I get it around, I pull it against my body so the air squishes out of that pillows and I think, “Alright, I’ve done it.” Now I have to do this again. How am I going to slide this other pillow down? I consider asking the man that I just ignored if he can slide the pillow in between the back of the backpack and the other pillow. But I don’t want to talk to him. Then I see the tenant come down from M.M.’s apartment at the top floor of the house. So I go walking back up out of the lecture hall instead. M.M. is still there talking to some people who are continuing to exit. She says, “Oh wait a minute! I want to introduce you to my tenant.” She calls him the Chinaman. I think, “Wow, why doesn’t she give him a name?” He shakes my hand and I shake his. I say, “How long have you been living here?” He says, “Sixteen years.” I exclaim, “Sixteen years?!” and I look at M.M. and say, “I didn’t realize when you said it was a couple of years that it had been that long.” This is only significant because I haven't realized it’s been that long since she’s moved there with a tenant and I have not seen her. We chat for a little bit. He seems like a nice man. I ask him if he will slide the pillow down in between the other pillow and the back of the backpack. He says, “Sure no problem.” He does that. Then I say goodbye to everyone. I’m all packed up. I leave. I have my stuff. I go back out into the drizzling rainy day and start walking back down the avenue and that’s when I wake up.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,4/4/2020

14,,14/1/2020,"“The Arms Dealer” This dream setting is a busy small town, disproportionately overrun with criminals and crime rings for the size of its population. My consciousness has filtered down and is inhabiting a man who is involved in explosives. So my consciousness is inside this man who is in a store. It appears to be a bookstore that sells other sundry items. But his contact is the employee who works in the store. So he’s not there to buy books. I realize I’m not in my own body because I see my arm and it’s a man arm with a man hand. I look at my chest and am wearing a leather jacket that’s not mine. So I hand the store employee a piece of paper and it has three ingredients on it that my own consciousness suddenly recognizes as a recipe for gunpowder. Phosphorus. I can’t see the other two names, but that’s what I think. Then, he talks to the man behind the counter and sets a meetup time where they are also supposed to put their gunpowder in a warehouse that’s going to be picked up by someone else that night. That’s the point I realize they’ve both been hired by someone else to do this. Then the man exits teh bookstore door. He goes out. He turns right, goes one storefront down the street, and the building says, Scotts Decorating, but it has round cafe tables out in front. He sits down with his other two buddies and shares what he’s done at the bookstore and the meetup time tonight, and says, “Okay, does everybody have it clear what their roles are?” They nod and agree. Then I notice I have this dry cough. One of them says, “Eh, shouldn’t you bow out of this because of your cough? Aren’t we not supposed to jostle this material or there’s the danger of it exploding?” Man consciousness me says, “No, it’s okay. It’ll be fine.” The part of my own consciousness that’s trapped in there says, “You have to be kidding! Why are you in denial of this? You can’t have any cough. It’s not supposed to be jostled once.” I feel frustrated inside this guy’s consciousness. Then, he has a few things that he’s gathered and puts his arms around them and carries them. It feels like the way it would feel as though you were carrying two bags of groceries with loaves of bread in them with one tucked under each arm. I compare it to this. Then he walks up the alleyway and into his house. I notice that the house is really overcrowded and has toys and books and stuff everywhere - belonging to someone who never cleans up. Then he goes into the kitchen and the rack they use in restaurants for putting dishes on and then putting them through an autoclave machine - he sets three loaves of bread on the dish rack and puts them in the oven, but doesn’t turn it on yet. He’s still got this dry cough, and I think, “Wow, isn’t this guy going to take care of that?” But he doesn’t. Then he sits down at the table, ostensibly to wait while these things do whatever they have to do in the oven. Then the part of the man that’s my consciousness starts to take over and the man consciousness starts to go away. Now I’m me and I’m sitting there looking around at this mess and thinking, “Ugh, I have to start cleaning this up.” Then across from the table, Omar appears. I tell him, “What is wrong with these people? Why is everybody in denial? There's so many other choices that people make. I don’t get it.” He nods his head and agrees, then asks me if it’s okay if he uses my bicycle from the garage. I say, “Yeah, do you know which one it is?” He says, “Yeah, I think so. It’s the one your ex-husband’s been using.” I say, “What?! What are you talking about? Why would either one of you want to use my bicycle?” It’s got the two white bars that go down and purple - it looks like a girl’s bike. He says, “That’s not what it looks like now.” I say, “What does it look like?” He says, “Well, your husband modified it. It’s got a motorcycle seat on it. And he took out the hump in the middle, so you can sit upright on it.” I’m starting to get riled up because he never asked me if he could do that. Then I look back at Omar and say, “This is the problem! He never respects my boundaries and he always does these things without asking first. Do you think it’s unreasonable that it upsets me?” He says, “No that is a normal thing.” Then he makes reference to his ex-wife and he says, “Even in my marriage, we asked each other for permission.” Then he starts laughing and he takes a piece of paper and shows me - it’s written the way you would write out a script in a play with the one person’s name, then the colon and the line then the other person. There’s 10 lines of just one-liners. First it’s him and his ex-wife, him and his ex-wife, yes, no, yes, no, yes, no, all the way down. Then one of them throws their hands up in exasperation and says: “Okay fine!” So he just hands it to me and I read this. Then he’s laughing and says, “Well at least it’s agreement.” Then I’m laughing, too, and say, “Yeah, it’s better than just taking it without asking, then modifying, then just walking away again, leaving it in the modified form so I can’t use it anymore.” Then he says, “Alright, well I have to go to work.” So I follow him down the hallway. As I’m passing through the kitchen, I look at the store and think, “Why is it at 77 degrees Celsius?!” I look with alarm and think, “Oh yeah, that’s from the man consciousness body.” I see the three loaves of bread in there and they are starting to disintegrate with the heat. It’s vaporizing the plastic bags, and I think, “Oh, isn’t that going to melt and cause some trouble in there?” But the temperature is so high that it just vaporizes. Then I realize I have to leave that there because this is the man consciousness’ house. But when I get in the hallway and go to say goodbye to Omar, I see two jackets. I realize one is the 4 year old boy, one is the 8 year old boy, and I look at Omar in alarm and say, “What are they doing here in this house?! They’re not supposed to be here.” But the part of me that is also in the man’s body sees that they belong to his kids. The consciousness that is me suddenly categorizes the overcrowding of stuff and not tidying up and putting away is from his kids. He’s making this money and also has this dual role of taking care of his family even though he’s doing it illegally. At that moment, he’s simultaneously opening the door and there’s my own two cats. They get out of the house and start to go up the street which is now a different street. It’s crowded with people and families. Kids are playing in the snow and it’s wintertime. Everybody has on snowsuits. There are toboggans and some ice and people are skating. I see my one cat has been interested by a bird. There is a group of people that are around my other cat and they’re putting snow on him and patting him with the snow and he’s enjoying it. So I get her first - I catch her just before she leaps into the air to take off after the bird. But I know I can’t carry them both at the same time. So as I’m walking back to what is now my own house, I see Kathryn, one of my students, and I ask if she can hold my cat for a moment while I get the other one. She says, “Oh no, I’ll just grab this one.” And she gets the second cat while I still have my first cat and am putting him back in the house. Then she sets him down for a second while she frolics off and does something else. I just think, “What is wrong with people that they just can’t follow through?” Then I put my tiny almost brittle cat back (her spine is uncomfortable when you pick her up and she gets squirmy) in the house and pick up my other one - he’s much heavier. I can feel his fur and his heavy body and his skin. So now they’re both back in the house. Everybody is safe and it’s just my house. My dream ends there.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,10/4/2020
15,,15/1/2020,"“The Greenhouse” This dream begins in the house I grew up in for a little while. I’m standing in the driveway and I see my ex-husband drive up. He’s in a van and he comes out of the van. He’s loading things from the back of the van onto the driveway. I see his dead son, whom I never met in real life, get out of the van with him and sit on the driveway. Then my ex is busy with something at the other end of the driveway. Now there’s a hill where the back up the van is, going up to where my ex is busy. His dead son is trying to climb up the hill to get to him, but he can’t because he can’t walk. He was crippled in real life. So I go over to help him. I put my arm around his waist and my other hand is digging at the earth and I’m dragging him up with me so he can get there. Now it’s muddy and I keep sliding back down. We finally make it to the top and we’re both covered with mud. I see the son is beside his dad. I turn around and go inside the house to clean myself up. As I’m doing this, I notice that mud has been tracked into the house - into the kitchen and dining room. I want to clean it up and wonder how it got in here. I realize that his dead son has been walking through the house. I have something in my hand - I think it’s a cloth to wipe up the mud with. I notice that already there’s potato bugs and worms crawling around. The worms are like maggots. They’re stretching themselves across the floor, then shrinking up into smaller things. They’re migrating rather quickly. Then the cat comes in and starts walking though it. I’m like, “No! Stop, stop!” The cat goes backwards, but doesn’t see where it’s going and it falls all the way down the stairs. I’m like oh no! I run down the stairs and pick up the cat. It’s fine, but I feel horrible for yelling at it. I’m cradling it in my arms and see that it’s got two blue pieces of paper in its eyes keeping its eyelids open. One of the papers is frayed enough that I can just grab it in between my fingernails and pull it out. The other one is still in there. The cat starts to squirm and wants to get down. The ex comes in and says, “How did this mud get in here?” I say, “Well, Luke must have tracked it in.” He glares at me and gets really angry and says, “Don’t you dare say that name out loud.” I’m like, “What are you talking about? He was here. Didn't you see him outside at the top of the hill?” Now he’s really mad at me and tells me I’m a liar and stop saying that. So I say to him, “You didn't see him?” Then he storms out of the house. Then I remember that Luke told me to get vinegar to pour on it. So I go into the kitchen to get vinegar out from underneath the sink. I pour it on top of the mud that has the maggots and stuff in it. They all die. Then as I’m cleaning up, the dream deconstructs. I’m suddenly in my maternal grandparents’ house. I’m in the process of planting a garden. Their house is huge. It’s like a mansion down by the shore of the lake. The greenhouse has long raised beds in it and really tall domed windows that arc over the top. They’re really dirty. There’s an old garden that looks like it hasn’t been tended for a while. I leave the greenhouse and walk across the grounds into a shed and find some tools. But as I open the shed door - it’s creaky and there are cobwebs. I find a hoe and some shears. I take them back to the greenhouse. I start to till and aerate the earth with the hoe. I notice that some of the plants that decayed and died have seeds in them. I’m making sure that I shake the plant - agitate it a little, so some of the seeds go into the earth as I’m hoeing. Then a man comes up - I assume he is the gardener. He is wearing a uniform and he questions what I’m doing. I tell him I am restoring the garden. He starts giving me some instructions. I say, “Did you used to be the gardener here?” He says yes. I realize that he’s also dead. He can’t do what he’s instructing me to do. So I listen to him. I ask if he knows where there’s any vinegar. He says, “Yes, there is some here. I will arrange for it to be delivered to you.” So I start to till up one side - there are two long raised beds, 30 feet long each. As I till the greyed earth on top, I see there’s rich black earth underneath. I feel inspired by this task. Then I see that some kind of delivery has appeared. I remember that I also asked him for some balck earth. So there’s a bag of black earth and some vinegar. There’re also buckets, cloths and a sponge mop. I think, “Great, I can wash these windows so the sun can come through.” I do that. It looks beautiful. Then on the other side, there’s a child - I don’t know who it is. I start showing them how to till up the earth so that seeds can be planted in holes, then how you can make the raised be up around the small plants, then you’ve got a little line between where water can go and people can walk if needed. So this child is helping me, but I still don’t know who it is. At the end of the day, I end up with some tall seed flowers in the back, some sustainable things we can eat coming up, as well as some herbs. There’s soup herbs, soup vegetables, fruit, nuts, pollinator flowers and natural insect repellent flowers. I picked red, yellow, orange and purple flowers. So it’s going to be a beautiful garden. We’re not all done, but it’s just too much to do in one day, so we leave. The child disappears. I’m walking across the grounds which are quite large. It takes a little bit of time to walk. When I get to the other side, I’m at the road. I walk up the road. I start to go through the outskirts and through old suburbia with 300 year old trees. I come to a house and realize it’s a rental. There’s a bottom floor for rent and top floor for rent. Suddenly a real estate agent appears and is describing when the tenants are leaving. The bottom floor is going to be empty today, the top floor tenants aren’t going to be leaving for a couple weeks. So she asks if I’m interested in the bottom floor. Since they are in the process of moving, it’s okay for us to go in. I really like it. I love the treed lot. There’s lots of natural shade over the sleeping area. The bedrooms are large and I like how the bedrooms are separated from the activity part of the house. So it will be good for sleeping. The kitchen is nice and big - there’s enough space for eating and a prep area. So I tell her that I’ll take it, but I’m also wanting to put a catio outside of the entry to the backyard so I can put my cats in it and they'll have lots of space to climb and run. Now the current tenant is there. Suddenly he has something I can easily use as a catio. He has a strange creature in it. At first I think it’s a dog, but as I get closer, I realize it’s some kind of rodent about the size of a small dog. I think it’s from South America. He’s a very sullen man - he doesn’t look like he wants to talk. I do ask him what kind of pet that is. He doesn’t answer me. He keeps the same expression on his face. We go back into the house and now I realize that I need roommates for this because there are four bedrooms and I can’t afford it by myself. There's the question of who will be the roommates. The real estate agent is interviewing some people. Two of them I know there is no way I can live with. One is someone I know and have actually lived with before, and I say, “Yes, that will work. Please interview her.” Suddenly I’m moved in and I’ve been living there for a little while. I have two other roommates. I feel like they came with the house. The one roommate’s bedroom, when I’m trying to sleep, they’re sleeping area moves out like an extending wall in a motorhome. When he goes in to sleep, the bed extends over the feet of my bed and I can’t stretch my legs out when I'm sleeping. So I don’t like this arrangement. I contact the real estate agent and say, “Okay, it’s been a couple weeks. Are the other tenants getting ready to move out?” She says yes. So I look at their place. It’s a little smaller, but I will still be able to keep the catio for my cats. So my dream ends where I’m saying, “Can we either ask these two other guys to move out, or is it okay that I just transfer my lease to the other side of the house?”",Dreamer 3,Freya,environment,12/4/2020
16,,16/1/2020,"“The Bird Cage” In this dream, I am in an apartment building and my neighbor has asked me to feed his dog while he’s away. He’s not away for very long, just a couple hours. So when I enter the apartment, the door is not locked. In fact, it’s ajar. The dog is just lying down on the floor. He has birds in a birdcage. The birds are making a really loud noise. As I approach the birdcage, I notice the door is wide open. The cage is rectangular, 2 feet long, a foot high, and a foot deep. So the door is 2 foot by 1 foot and is open. Yet the birds don’t try to leave. The song is not the song they would normally make and this puzzles me. There’s a mixture of birds - pigeons, song birds, sparrows. None of them are making their song. It’s this rapid alarm noise and they’re all making it despite different species, which also puzzles me. I wonder if they’re afraid of the dog. But I’ve been in this apartment before visiting, and I know that the birds and the dog will sit together on the floor, so I don’t think that’s the reason. So I feed the dog. Then I wonder why he hasn’t asked me to feed the birds. I look around to see if there’s any food and there isn’t. Then I’m curious about this noise they’re making again. And I wonder why they don’t fly out of the cage because they sound afraid to me. As I get closer to the cage, their noise stops. As I back away, it gets louder. I wonder if I should stay to comfort them. Then the dream just ends.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,15/4/2020
17,,17/1/2020,"“The Swan Costume” In this dream, I’m in Spain, I think. It’s a warm balmy country and although I don't see the ocean, I feel it in the air. The place I’m in is a palazzo. Everything is made of stucco -hardened and painted these warm brilliant colors like deep red and deep orange. The floor is also made of the same thing, but it’s painted a deep grey. IIn this dream I am Spanish. My skin is darker, my hair is a dark brown. I work as part of a family and with my family in this palazzo. My father is a police officer. He’s investigating some kind of credit card crime. He has stolen credit cards tucked into a book that’s like a photo album that closes with a zipper and is leather. Sometimes he asks me to get it and move it from its secure location up to where he is because he is missing some aspects of this case. The other thing I do is I get him some other materials. It’s like he’s training me to be an investigator. So I do this running around the palazzo in different rooms on different floors for him. Then at one point, in the dream, it deviates. I’m in a different country. I'm a different person. I’m in a kitchen scene where I’m trying to get my sibling to help me with the dishes. There are two sinks - one on an island and one on a counter. There are piles and piles of dishes. My sibling keeps only washing one dish then sitting down on the floor. I keep washing 50 then turning around and there’s only 1. My sibling is supposed to be doing this at the island and I’m supposed to be doing this at the other sink. Then I’m putting them away in a pantry in a slightly different room around the corner. At one of these times in the pantry, I have a plant. It just suddenly appears in my hand. I’m trying to figure out where it goes in the pantry. I open up a cupboard and it has all these wooden slats that would be part of blinds - like the California shutters you close over your windows. It’s a historical chronology of the evolution of a slat of a blind. I think, “Oh, that’s kind of interesting.” I look at it. I have the plant in the other hand. I think, “Hmm, now the seeds from the plant are gone.” I’m moving the slats on the shudder in a cupboard and it’s chafed the seeds out and collected them. So I close the cupboard board and put the bare plant on the counter. I turn around and now there are more dishes on the island. My sibling is doing nothing. I speak sharply to him. I refresh the water in the sink and put the plug back in. I notice that there’s 4 inches of unwashed cutlery in the bottom that he's been pretending to do. I speak sharply to him about that. Then I do some of it myself, but am thinking that if I keep doing this myself, he’s never going to learn to do it. So I put fresh water in then turn the tap off and tell him he needs to do his work if he’s ever going to get out of the area. I go back and finish my own. I’m disgusted in the dream by the sludge in the bottom of the sink and the pile of food bits and organic waste in the plug that I have to pluck out and dump. The dream flips back to the other scene where I’m in this palazzo in Spain. Now, the day has progressed and it’s almost nighttime. My father’s gone. I don’t know where he is. I’m suddenly supposed to be helping these people find costumes for a masquerade. They come in and I’m at the end of the palazzo. There’s a really long bar of clothing hanging from it. People are coming in one at a time, saying what they want to look like. I go through the clothes hanging from the bar and I hand them one and they just walk away with it. It’s not a line up and not a popular thing. I start to look through the clothing. I become absorbed by the feel of the material. The satins are really dark, the black is really inky and they feel smooth under my fingers. Then this woman comes up. She says, “Do I have something that will make her have a more shapely butt?” I think, “I don’t know.” I start looking through the clothing and I find something. She says, “How do I use this?” Now I’m wearing black gloves. As I’m looking through, the knowledge comes to me and I say, “You put this part on and it pushes your low back down into your butt, which loosens the skin a bit. Then you put this part on and it pushes from the hamstrings up to fill it.” Then I warn her that it says on the tag to be very careful because this can be hard or dangerous for your low back. Then there’s a costumed part that goes around the upper body. It kind of looks like a man’s lapel from a suit. So she takes it anyway and walks away. Then I’m concerned about this. I go to try and find the mother - she’s not my mother, she’s just another part of the family that works there. I tell her that someone just wanted that costume. She doesn’t reply to my question. She says, “I have something I think you would really like. Wait here for a second.” She goes and gets it. It’s white. She says, “Here, feel this.” I feel it and it’s got form to it. It’s white. There’s a feathery feel, like the way feathers would feel on a white bird if you just ran your hand over the top of its head and down towards the back with the grain of the feathers. It’s not stretchy material. It has form to it like a ballet dancer’s costume. She says to go try it on. As I do this, I see her nephew come in. He’s a man. He sees me holding that in my hand. Then he looks down. I feel there’s some kind of disapproval and also some attraction in his eyes. I go into the bathroom and put it on. I make sure I go into the small bathroom only made for only one person because I don’t want anyone else to see me in this, but I do want to see what it looks like. It has a full length mirror in it. So I put it on. I like the way it contrasts with my brown skin. It feels really nice when I put it on. It has a little bit of weight to it. When I turn around and look in the back, first I notice there’s a bikini line on my body which is at odds with the line of the costume. The back of the costume comes up like a thong and there’s a big scooped part that goes up over my hips from the leg. Because it’s got form to it, it doesn’t sit on my body - it doesn’t cling to it. It moves a little bit when I move. I’m slightly concerned about this because it’s a bit big for me. But I turn around and it’s also got these four other pieces that are about maybe 8 inches long, curved gently like an “S” the way the downstruck in treble clef goes. They’re also white and they’ve got downy feathers around the top. I realize they’re to frame my eyes. They tuck in with little straps at the top of the costume quite nicely and stay there. So the one curved in sits on the top of the shoulder and it goes up the side of my neck and then curves again gently underneath my eyes towards the inside of my nose. There are two on each side - one goes to the inside of the eye, one goes to the outside of the eye. I actually really like these and I spend a few moments admiring the craftsmanship , the velvety feel of them and the way they fit over the top of the shoulders. I like how they feel around the outside of my eyes. They kind of hide the eyes, too, because it’s like a masquerade. Then I turn around because I’m concerned that the costume moves a little bit of its own accord when I’m walking. Now I notice I’ve got these really high white heels on. I’m wishing there was some carpeting on the floor because they’re quite slippery against the painted stucco and that makes me feel a little nervous. But as I turn around and check out the back again, I bend over a little and think I can't bend over in this and have anyone see me because you can see more of my anatomy than I want roving eyes to be looking at. But as I do this, I feel myself turned on. I feel that move from my body as I look back at the front view in the mirror, I feel heat between my legs and a warmth in my yoni that’s spreading outwards. I can feel the beginnings of an orgasm and this wakes me up.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,16/4/2020
18,,18/1/2020,"“Getting Ready to Cast Off” I’m on my friend Lynn’s sailboat. She’s invited a bunch of people to crew for her. We’re going on a trip. As is typical, if possible, people are supposed to get down to the boat early, unpack, get everything ready, then cast off. So I’ve got a small pack with my clothes and necessities in it. I go to where I’m sleeping on the boat and arrange everything. I unpack and secure it so nothing is going to fly around. Then we’re waiting because the wind has died down. We’re waiting for the wind to pick up. There’s a dinghy. Normally dinghies are just the bottom part of a boat. This one has an inflatable mast and sail on it. It’s really silly. I’m on this dinghy and it’s tied off to the middle of the ship. At first I’m just standing on the inflatable outside part. I’m hanging on to the mast and sail. It’s going from one side of the boat, around the bow, down the other side of the boat, to the stern, and it goes back up, around, and down. I’m just lazily going around and around like this. Then I think, “Hmm, I could actually fall asleep here.” I’m in danger of doing so. I think, “Well, I better not fall asleep.” So I lean back for a little and create a little resistance on the rope. Again it wanders from port to bow to starboard to stern and back. I do this for a little while. I think, “Well, I really don't even need this inflatable sailboat.” I twine the rope around the soles of my feet and I climb up it a little bit. Now, because of my body weight, I’m going around from port, bow, starboard, stern quite a bit faster. I’m starting to swing around it. The inflatable dinghy has now just disappeared - it’s not in the dreamscape anymore. I’m swinging around on this rope. I’m really enjoying this swinging part. So I move with the momentum, the way you would do with your body if you were on a swing. I’m moving with my core in order to get it to move faster, and I’m flying quite quickly through the air now. I start to laugh because it feels really good to do that kind of play. I do it 7 or 8 times, then I can feel the rope starting to pull on the skin of my palms and feed. So I decide to do it just one more time and the next time I come around midship, I’ll just swing in and land on the deck on my feet, which I do. I pull the rope in so it doesn’t get tangled on anything. Now I’m wondering what else I’m going to do. I notice that on the lower part of the deck, are two or three boxes pushed up underneath. I take them out and they’ve got paints in them. There's blue and orange and white. I think, “Oh those are nice contrast colors. Maybe I’ll paint rocks.” So all of a sudden, there’s another person who I actually work with, though I’ve never sailed with her - I don’t think she sails. She’s been invited to go on the boat. I’m surprised but glad to see her. I look over at what she’s doing to pass the time and she’s painting rocks. I think, “Well this will work. I wonder what kind of paint she’s used.” I kind of go up tentatively because I don’t want to interrupt her. But she looks up from her work and I say, “What kind of paint are you using for that?” She tells me that it’s an acrylic. I ask her if she brought it withher or bought it. She says, “No, I just came back from Michael’s Craft Store, although Lynn made a rather big deal about not wanting anyone to go there. She called me on the phone first to tell me this because they’re doing something that’s against her politics. But I decided I was going to go anyway.” So I ask her where it is and she says, “Here, it’s on this map and it’s marked with an X so that we don’t go there.” I look and I notice that closeby is a Dollar Store and they probably have paint. I don’t want Lynn to know I’ve gone to Michael’s as well because she’ll be upset. So I think, “I’ll just go to the Dollar Store.” As I’m walking to the Dollar Store, I don’t have any shoes. I’m in my bare feet. I can feel little stones under the sand. I start to look at the stones and see really incredible ones - some shaped like diamonds, but they’re just stones and I pick a few of those up. Now I’ve got a bag. There’s another one that’s the same blue as the paint on the ship on the top. I think the bottom of that will look really nice with the orange color on it, so I put that in the bag. Then I look at some other stones. One has a fossil of some kind of feathery fish spine. I think that will look nice - I’ll paint the raised up portion one color and the background another color. I put that in the bag. Then I pick up one more. It’s got this funny symbol on it that looks a little like a menorah. I put that in the bag. Then I’m walking to the Dollar Store. I go in, find paint and paintbrush, and put them in the bag, then walk back. Now the wind has picked up. I stash my paints underneath the deck because I think we’re going to cat off. But we don’t! It’s quite windy. Lynn comes out and she says she’s been sewing something. She asks me if I’d like to make something. I say, “Well, I suppose I could use a cotton top because they stow away nicely when you’re sailing and they also hold the water so you can jump in, get wet, and they hold their shape and it’s very cooling. So I’ll make one of those.” So she tells me to go back under the deck and look for some material. That’s the end of the dream.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,17/4/2020

I knock on the door, but no one is answering and no one is there.",Dreamer 3,Freya,environment,23/4/2020
20,,20/1/2020,"“The Lost Girl” This was a nightmare, definitely odd. The thing that made it odd is that when I woke up, I was frozen and thought I actually had a little girl with me and the only dream I had last night was with my ex throwing my son’s camping equipment in the garbage. It was like a dream in a dream. When I thought I was awake, the dream I recalled was going camping and spreading a round blanket out on the ground, and then sleeping bag on top of that. This is what my son slept in. His dad was to pick him up that day and take him overnight from the campground. So I rolled up the ground sheet and the round blanket. There was another layer, like a spongy mat you sleep on top of. They were all circular. I rolled them all up and put them in the back of my son’s dad’s car. Instead of them actually driving away, I’m in the backseat. As I see them approach his house, he pulls over first. It’s like a dumpster in the back of a store - a really big kind for large stores. He takes the roll of my son’s sleeping stuff out of the trunk and throws it in the dumpster. I said, “What are you doing? Why would you do that?” He said, “Because it was dirty.” I say, “That’s what washing machines are for.” He just shrugged his shoulder and said it doesn’t matter. I said, “It does matter! We go camping all the time. I’m going to need that.” He just didn’t respond. So I took a piece of paper and wrote down the three items on it and put them in my son’s pocket and said, “Next time we go camping, you’re going to have to replace that.” Then, a few minutes later, I checked my son’s pocket. The note was gone and his dad had thrown it in the garbage. This was very upsetting to me. Then I arrived home. My son didn’t even stay overnight at his dad’s, we just got out of the car and came back into my house. I am in the living room of my house and just sitting there. All of a sudden, this family appears around me. In the dream, they’re mine, but they aren’t my actual family. There are parents and they take kids and are hunting and terrorizing them. I’m watching this. I’m traumatized. They’ve got two - one is a girl, but she's an adult, and the other is an adult male. Although we’re not going anywhere, this scene takes place in the living room where they’re being hunted and shot. It’s muddy. At first the woman is naked. She is pausing at the bottom of a tree. Then the family takes aim - they’ve got a crossbow - and they miss. The woman falls down in the mud. Then they aim at the young man. I wonder why he has underwear and the woman was naked. When I look back at the woman, she’s got something covering her breasts and a small pair of underwear. At this point in time, I notice there is another girl that is playing on a climber, but it’s inside the house in the living room. I think, “Where did she come from?” Then I realize that they’ve also captured her. I wonder what horrors are waiting for this girl. I go ove by the climber. She looks happy and carefree. I ask her what her name is. She doesn’t reply. In fact, she hasn’t spoken to anyone yet. One of the family members comments that they haven’t been able to get anything out of her. They’re going to wait to hunt her until she is speaking. So I think, “Okay, this gives me some time to find out who she is and send her back to her own family where she belongs.” So, after a little bit of sitting beside her, she climbs off the climber and I take her by the hand. I sit her on my knee. I see there’s a diaper bag beside the couch. I ask her if it’s hers. She nods. So I start to unpack it and there’s a little toy inside it. I pretend that I’m driving the toy around. She starts to talk and says, “Oh, this is where we went when we came down from Halton.” I say, “Oh, did one of your parents say that?” She nods her head. So I write that down on the piece of paper: “Parent says, came from Halton.” Halton is a town nearby. Then, I say, “Where did you go when your parents dropped you off?” She says, “Um, big red engine.” I say, “Oh there’s a train?” I draw a picture of a train and she nods. So I write that down. I say, “What else is there?” She says, “Zoom down yellow slide!” So I write that down. Then I’m thinking and say, “Oh, is this where you play outside when your parents drop you off?” She nods her head. I think, “Oh she goes to daycare.” Then I write daycare down on the piece of paper. I draw a picture of a building with a sign on the front - there are no letters. I say, “Is this your daycare?” She doesn’t say yes or no. I say, “Is there a name? Is it called something?” She repeats, “big red engine and yellow slide.” So I realize I don’t have a name for the daycare. I ask her if she has a friend at the daycare. She goes back to playing with the little toy. I ask her if there is a teacher there. She also just giggles and mimics actions that show play. I keep unpacking her bag and find t-shirts. I hold up a t-shirt, but it looks bigger than she is and as if it belongs to a little boy. So I say, “Is this yours?” She nods her head. I keep unpacking her bag. I see a picture of her and an older boy. I show it to her and am excited. I tap the picture of the boy and say, “Who’s this?” She says, “Myrrh.” I say, “Older brother, Myrrh.” Then I think I could maybe get the names of her parents. I say, “When your mom is talking to your dad, what does she call your dad?” She tells me and I write that down on the piece of paper. Then I just play for a little bit because I don’t want her to clam up because I’m asking too many questions. So we play for a little bit longer. Then I ask her what her dad calls her mom and she tells me. So I write that down. She only tells me their first names. I’m trying to get the last name, but she doesn’t seem to know. I’ve asked her and she doesn’t know. Now I’m feeling I’ve got what the daycare looks like, where she might actually live and her parents’ first names. I don’t know her name yet, though. She hasn’t been able to answer me and tell me her name yet. Anyway, I take her by the hand and go into the other room and I call the police. When the officer answers the phone, I identify myself. Now I’m crying. I’m telling them that my parents have kidnapped a girl, but I don’t know who she is and she doesn’t have any identification, but I’ve got a little bit of information. I ask if they can come and get her. I’m also worried that they’re going to keep her in jail overnight because now it’s dark - it’s the middle of the night and it’s taken me a few hours to get his information. I’m asking if they can leave her here with me overnight and come get her in the morning. The officer says, “Well, we’ll decide that when we get there.” So, the officer pulls up in front of my house and comes in. Now they’re telling me that she might have rabies and we all need rabies shots. So, in order to give the rabies shots - you know how in a dance, all the choral dancers can hold onto a piece of fabric tightly and then they pump it so there’s air in the middle and the principal dancer will stand on the air in the middle and the choral dancers lift up the fabric and she’s floating - they’re telling me I need to pump. Now there’s another officer, a female. This thing we are pumping is circular - the same size and look as my son’s sleeping equipment that I thought was thrown in the garbage. They’re telling me to pump it and hold the three layers together with my fingers. As we pump, the vaccine will be created in the center between these layers. The little girl is still standing beside me. The police officers said that as long as we’re vaccinated, I can keep her overnight and they’ll come get her in the morning. In the meantime, they’re going to put the data in that I’ve given them and see if they can find a family. This was my idea - I say, “Is there any way you can put this information in, because they’re obviously missing her and would have reported her missing? Here, I have their first names already!” They agree to do that, but will leave her with me and see if there’s another family that has reported her missing.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,29/4/2020
21,,21/1/2020,"“The Reunion” I’m invited to some kind of gathering, I don’t know what the purpose is, except that I feel I should go. I have a little hesitancy about this because it’s enough of a drive for me that I’m thinking that by the time I get there, I’m going to have to turn around and come back or sleep overnight, which I haven't been invited to do. I’m wondering if I really want to drive basically all night only to stay for an hour. But because I think I should go, I get in my car after putting a few things together in a bag. A couple of things are what you would bring as a hostess gift. I think there’s a bottle of wine - there’s something in a bottle anyway - and something else wrapped up in a small bag. In fact I’ve got a couple of other small bags. When I arrive I just park the car. I’ve never been to this house before. I walk in and see some people that I don’t know very well but I recognize them. There's about 10 or 15 of these. I see that there’s a friend I used to be close to, but am no longer. I see that Omar’s brother, Mike is there. I haven't seen him in a long time. He’s the one person I do have warm feelings towards. So I go sit beside him. He sees me, stands up and gives me a hug and says, “it’s been a long time.” I say, “Yes it has.” We sit down next to each other and we’re getting caught up. Then it appears that the meal is about to start and we’re asked to take our seats. Unfortunately, there’s a seating plan and I have to look for where my name is. I see that I’m seated beside a woman I used to be close with and am no longer, and the person on the other side is someone I don’t know. So I’m not very happy about this. She’s apparently acting as though she’s happy to see me and is quite chatty. She’s acting as though nothing has happened between us. I feel my inner eyes roll at this. I don't want to interact with her or pretend like there’s nothing wrong. The dinner progresses. I realize I haven’t given the hostess the things I brought, so I excuse myself from the table and go find my bags and give them to the hostess. When I get back from doing that though, more people have left their seats. I’m kind of relieved. I didn’t eat very much, but at least I’m not stranded in this awkward and ingenuous conversation with the woman. I realize that there’s been a gift for each of the people at their seats. They didn’t even notice it. The hostess is a little bit distressed about this - the fact that no one brought anything with them and that no one has noticed that there’s gifts at the table for each of them, and furthermore that people came and brought their toddlers and kids and left them unsupervised running all over the house. Basically what’s happened is the guests have been quite oblivious as guests and taken way more latitude than was offered and the house is trashed. Everything is everywhere. The guests have all left. They haven’t even taken their plates from the table. It’s just a mess. So I just start cleaning up. I’m helping by clearing the table and doing dishes. I make a point of thanking the hostess for my gift, which is a pair of silver candleholders that are like the Kokopeli character and they look like they were fashioned in Mexico. I thank her for her thoughtfulness. There’s also a gingerbread kit where the pieces of gingerbread are wrapped up in saran wrap. You would make your own icing and put them together. It’s a little mini house. As I’m thanking her, she’s enough upset that no one else did, that my words kind of fall around her like they’re unprocessed by her. She goes down into the basement. I don’t know what she’s doing down there. I am still cleaning upstairs. I continue helping with the dishes. There are a couple other of her family members - her two kids are helping. The dishes basically get done, but it takes a little while. I go into another room where the toddlers have trashed it. Omar is there. We gaze at each other. I feel his eyes. He beckons to me. He wants me to lie down with him. I say, “No, I can’t do that. There are people and toddlers and stuff here.” We go upstairs. He’s cleaning, too, that’s what he was doing in the other room. We go upstairs and these kids have taken all the clothes out of the dresser. As I’m picking and folding clothes up, there’s a dirty diaper on the floor. We are tidying all of this up and trying to make their house right.",Dreamer 3,Freya,environment,8/5/2020
22,,22/1/2020,"“The Birthday Party” I’m at a house and the occasion is my friend’s birthday. She’s 50 on this birthday, although I don’t think that’s her real age. It’s a larger celebration with more people than normal. Many of them I don’t know. Because of this, her interactions with me are less frequent than they normally would be as she is running around greeting all the guests. I’m looking for someone I know. I’m reluctant to go into the house. I’ve arrived there with my son. He’s playing with some of the other kids of the people I don’t know. I have an eye on him. He’s about 4 or 5 years old in the dream. I know where he is and I can see he’s fine. I’m sitting on the grass enjoying the sun on my skin. I’m noticing the plants she has planted in her garden. I’m waiting for some of the people to greet her and settle somewhere, so we can have a conversation and I can give her the gift that I brought. However this doesn’t seem to be happening as there are a lot of people coming and going. So I decide to go for a walk. I look for my son. He’s not outside anymore. I ask someone if they’ve seen him. They say, “Yes, he went down that hallway.” They indicate with their finger which hallway. So I go down there, looking in the rooms with open doors. I realize that my friend’s husband is in the bathroom. I do not want to run into him. I’m hoping I’ll find my son soon. I see my son in a different bathroom across the hallway from the bathroom where her husband is in. My son is playing in the water. He’s taken off all his clothes. I ask him if he’ll get dressed and I tell him we’re going for a walk. He complies but is taking a really long time to do it. While he’s doing that, I exit the bathroom, continue walking down the hallway to the very last room and see my friend in there sitting and talking with a couple of women. She waves me over and I sit in a chair beside her. The conversation they started before I came into the room continues. It’s not about anything I care to converse about. It’s like, “What are we wearing today” - flat and doesn’t feel meaningful. I sit with them for a few minutes and then go back to the washroom where my son is. He’s dressed now. I take him by the hand and we start walking down the hallway and out. I notice for the whole duration of this dream, my friend’s husband is in the bathroom. As we’re leaving her house, I see a pair of plastic shorts. They’re kind of long - they go almost down to the top of the knee. There’s a perforated line where you can rip off the last 4 inches and make them into a normal length pair of shorts. For some reason, I pick them up and I do this. I fold at the perforated line and rip off the bottom 4 inches. Then I roll them up and am looking for a bag to put them in. I notice there’s a tag on them that says Size 10. I think, “Whose are these?” Then I’m looking for my friend to give them to. I look down in my hand and suddenly I also have a birthday card. Now I feel surprised that I appear to have picked up something in her house that doesn’t belong to me - a pair of transparent plastic shorts - and now I’m going to give them to her. I don’t want to because I feel like I haven’t purchased this fairly; I’ve just picked them up and taken them. It’s not even something I would give to her. I’m looking for a place to set these down. They just disappear out of my hand. Now I’m with my son on the outside of the house. I take him by the hand and we continue on our walk. We go all the way around the block - it’s a nice walk. When we come back, there are still all these people I don’t know. I feel like I don’t belong there. I’m relieved to see her husband isn’t there. She’s sitting on the porch. I go up to tell her we’re going and maybe I’ll be back tomorrow when there aren’t so many people around. She smiles at me. I smile back. I get in the car with my son and leave.",Dreamer 3,Freya,BLM,8/6/2020
23,,23/1/2020,"“The Curio Shop” My kids and I have ridden our bicycles to this shop on a street where everything is closing down. The whole street is closing down and everything is 50-80% off. We need some spoons. I’m hoping I can get some yarn. So we go to the Curio Shop. It’s the kind of store that is packed with all kinds of stuff in it. There are a lot of people in it, too - about four shopkeepers, a couple men, a couple women. The walls go up really, really high. You can’t even see what’s on the top shelves. My kids are looking at various things. I feel pulled in different directions. I also don’t want them to get involved in looking at stuff. We’re only there to get yarn and a spoon. They’re being pulled towards the back of the shop and the spoons are in a jar in the front of the shop. I go back to get them. The floor slopes downwards like a loading ramp at the back of the shop. One of my kids is stuck there. I notice that there is some really dirty murky water. There are creatures that live in the water. One of them has reached up and has a hold of one of my children and is starting to pull him into the murky water. So we pull him - we’ve got his arms and legs. Instead of pulling just him up, this strange creature that's attached to him comes with him. I don’t know how to describe it. It’s purple, but it’s red, but it’s blue. It’s got fur all over. The fur doesn’t look soft. It looks a little bit creepy but also a little bit cute. So now there’s this creature in the store and my son’s got him. I don’t want to put it back in the water because it wants to stay with us and the water looks decidedly evil, so I feel it’s the wrong thing to do. So we carry on. We go back towards the front of the store and finally the line has moved. I see the wooden spoons with long handles for stirring things in a big pot. The crowd around is gone. I look at the price and even though they’re half off, they’re still really expensive and I don’t think I need a spoon that badly. I don’t want to spend the money on it. The shopkeeper does ask me what I’m looking at it. I say I was looking at the spoons. She comes over and points out the price. There are six prices and she says, “It’s this one.” I still think it’s expensive and say I don’t want it. In the meantime, I turn around and my son is missing. I say, “Where’s my son?” One of the male shopkeepers says, “You’ll have to follow me.” So I go out of the store and I can feel myself getting really angry. My daughter is still with me. When I go out of the store, theThey tell me I have to come back the next day. I’m like, “What?!” and it just bursts out of my body. I’m raging at them. They say that I have to follow them because now I'm being processed. I have to go into this building with them for this processing. We walk about three really long city blocks up the street into another building that looks like it’s been a warehouse. My daughter and I are sitting there. I’m waiting for the officers to do what they need to do. One of them tells me I have to follow hi. We go around the side of the building and there are a whole bunch of storage units. He has a key. There are two doors side by side and they have Disney characters on the front of them. I think that’s strange. He opens the door and there's nothing in the storage unit. He tells me I have to follow him in there. I say, “No way am I following you. There is nothing I need to do in there alone with you in that storage unit!” So I start to run back into the building. I grab my daughter and I say, “Run! We have to get out of here!” So we start running. I don’t want to go into the street, so we are going behind the buildings. There are tall bulrushes and mucky water and we are rushing around. I can see both of them. We’re still ahead of them. All of the buildings are deserted but locked - we can’t get in. So we keep running. We find this building and the door is open in the back. There appears to be other people conducting business around the front and I think, “Well, let’s go in there. There are other people.” The door opens, we go up the stairs to a fashion fabric kind of thing. People are trying on clothes and whatnot. I say to my daughter, “Let’s change our clothes, “ so we do. Then I see that the other officer (not the one who wanted me to go into the storage unit with him). He’s right there. I tell him, “Your partner was trying to take me into the storage unit at the back. Come on, you can’t be doing things this wrong. I just want my son back.” He’s not helpful. In fact, he’s in league with the other one. So now we’re running in front of the building where the people are, which halts the officers. They can’t just grab us for nothing. We go out the front, which is busy with customers and other people. So we are trying to lose them in the crowd and we do this for about a block until we get back to the store. We find our way back to the store. I go to the front of the desk. There are still lots of people in there and the two women shopkeepers. I say loud enough that the other people around me can hear: “You’ve got my son! You’re holding him and I want him back.” Then I jump over the counter because the officer is behind there. I grab him by the throat and I tell him that he better give me my son back, or I will strangle him. So he says, “Fine fine, okay!” He writes this phone number down. I say, “A phone number?! Are you kidding me?!” I take the phone number and am trying to dial it. Now I’ve got one of those old fashioned flip phones. The numbers on the pad are really small. Every time I try to dial the number, it shows up on the screen wrong and I keep having to erase it and do it again, and erase it and do it again. I’m standing outside the building now. I keep putting the number in. It’s a 10-digit number. Now I’ve got 7 of the numbers put in. It’s like 164576476470, like that. The 4’s and 7’s won’t work. The two men that are shopkeepers that turn into officers are standing outside of the building. Now I’m sobbing and saying, “Just tell me where he is. Just go get him.” One of them says he’s in the basement. “The basement of this building?!” I yell at him. But the space between me and the building is getting bigger and bigger. I’m crying and sobbing and so angry. Now my emotions have broken through the dreamworld and I’m awake. I’m trying to get back into the dream, but I can’t.",Dreamer 3,Freya,BLM,10/6/2020
24,,24/1/2020,"“Angry Mob” All I remember is standing by feeling helpless while watching an angry mob. They were weaponized with sticks, clubs, baseball bats, things you could pound on with. They were filing up the street angrily shouting and it was a street that looked like a suburban street. They were smashing the cars that were parallel parked, smashing the hoods of the cars, breaking all the glass in the windows, getting on top of the cars and smashing the roofs and just going up the street doing this. In the dream, I watch this, feeling helpless to stop. I can’t permeate the crowd. I have nothing to protect myself with. Then the crowd is gone - they continued up the street and are out of sight now. I’m standing while other people come out of hiding. They are commenting on the damage. Somebody says, “I know who the first two cars belong to. The first one belongs to the president of yoga and the second one belongs to the vice president.”",Dreamer 3,Freya,BLM,11/6/2020
25,,25/1/2020,"“The Vegetable Garden” I’m in the backyard of the house I grew up in. I’m maybe about 20 years old, possibly a little bit younger. I’m with my dad. He’s teaching me how to grow a vegetable garden. The plot is quite large. There’s room for enough vegetables that will have to be kept over the winter. It will definitely feed maybe 6-8 people for a whole year. It's planned out quite meticulously with companion planting as well as staggered planting so that you don’t get a bumper crop of the same thing all at once. There’s corn and cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, cauliflower, beets, carrots, squash, lettuce, rhubarb, and herbs; and marigolds and chrysanthemums around the outside as a natural insecticide. Once it gets planted, which is quite a lengthy process, then we have to go back in and set up structures that will support the things as they grow upwards. There is something that looks like it’s for tomatoes, but it’s not in the tomato row. It’s suspended and there’s little baskets. I can’t figure out how it’s suspended because there’s nothing above it except sky. Then when I look at it, there are bits of other vegetables in it. I can see that there are pieces of cauliflower, so I’m puzzling over this. It also spins. There are about four of these on a long bar. I ask my dad what it is. He keeps appearing. Although I’ve done this all by myself, whenever I’m not sure what I’m doing, my dad just appears for guidance. While I’m puzzling over this, suddenly he is there again. I say, “What’s this for?” He says, “The vegetables on it are composting. The gas they emit is good for the atmosphere that the other vegetables are growing in. It’s like a Natural Miracle Grower.” I think, “Oh. Hmm, I didn't think methane was good to be near people.” So I get this garden going. There’s also another part where I’m fertilizing or something. It’s like an extension of the natural compost where I’m taking some of the pieces from the plants - like when you prune or something starts to grow and the bugs have gotten it and it’s no good. I’m grating it up almost like a food processor. I’m putting it into cheesecloth and leaving the cheesecloth in various places in the garden. At one point my dad comes in and says to me, “Be careful with this one that no one eats it. It was too close to your body when you broke it down into tiny pieces.” It’s almost like I put it through a food processor. But I don’t know what I’ve got on my body that’s doing this to it. It’s some unknown thing. He says, “Don’t let people eat this. You have to put it back into the ground. Make sure you put it back in the ground.” It’s like it was in my body and my body did the breaking down of it. So now the garden is in a state where I can just wait for things to start producing. The dream shifts. I’m at some kind of setting that feels like my paternal grandparents’ party. The house isn’t there, though. It looks like it geographically. There’s a building and people live in the building. There’s an orchard growing lengthwise from the building. Sometimes people plant orchards around the building where they live, but this one extends laterally. There’s all this empty grass - it’s like a wild meadow. I’m inside the building. The woman I’m speaking with is in charge of the building and the people who live there. She’s asked me to come and advise on a vegetable garden for her community. I tell her that it's already almost the end of June and there isn’t enough growing time to plant the kind of garden she wants. She wants one similar to the one I have that is already well underway at my own place. She’s insisting though. So I have to debate the point and explain it further, because she really doesn’t understand that by the time September comes or even if the growing season gives her until October, she’s going to have a whole bunch of plants, but no fruit or vegetables because they don't have enough time to germinate now in this type of weather. I do manage to convince her by saying, “However, this doesn’t mean there is nothing you can do this year. So what needs to be done is the grass and what you’ve got growing on the land for the vegetables needs to be removed. It can be aerated - tilled up. And there are a few things you can plant in long rows that have a short germination period. It will help to get everyone we’re training to be gardeners used to it this year.” So she agrees to that. So she says, “I’m going to get some people to help.” I see her doing this. Now I’m standing at a thing you leaned on at a reception counter, but it’s not. There are people who live there or staff that occasionally come out of a door behind that and then go back in. I don’t know what they’re doing. It’s not food service. So she’s standing behind there and as people come out the door, she’s asking them if they want to be part of the vegetable garden and they’re all saying no. I think, “Hmm, this isn’t going to go very well here in the way she’s presenting it.” I leave her to that and step off a bit to the side. There are a couple of other women that have a box. It’s got wallets in it that look handmade with carvings and are beautifully painted. There are some people, one of which is one of my YTT students. They’ve ordered wallets and are waiting to pick them up. One of them says to me, “Look, aren’t these beautiful?” She’s matching it with a matching hat and clothes she has on - indigo blues, pink and white. I think, “Wow, she’s really beautifully color coordinated.” But I don’t want to look in the box because I don't have any money and I don’t need a wallet to carry my money in. I also don’t want to spend my money on something I don’t need anyway. I make the comment to the person selling them that they are quite beautiful. Then I move away from that area. I go back to the lady and ask if she has any recruits for the garden. She says, “Not yet.” then someone comes out and the woman herself looks really downcast and defeated. I see the first woman, the one who is in charge, and instead of asking her if she wants to be part of this project, she tells her she has to. The person she says this to is every resigned. I think this whole presentation of community gardening is not going to work with this kind of asking without describing what it can do for them, or making it an order. So what I do is just leave the building. I walk to the area that will be used. I’m using my hands to pull up the grasses in a long straight line. The orchard trees on my left. I’m backing up with my body as I do this with my hands. One other person comes out - it’s the person who was ordered. I just allow her to watch as I do this. I do one long row of taking the grasses out. I'm doing it very slowly. The soil feels very fertile. It’s not hard. I can reach my fingers in and squish the soil. It’s dark and smells like earth. I know that whatever is grown here will eventually grow really well. I notice as my row is going very well, the other lady has just started and she’s mimicking what I’ve done. She’s doing it on her own and I just allow her to do that. The scene changes and it’s later. I’m just gazing at what I’ve planted. I think it’s radishes - they do germinate rather quickly. There’s a long row and they look really good.",Dreamer 3,Freya,environment,13/6/2020
26,,26/1/2020,"“Keep it Small” There’s some kind of outdoor grouping. There’s a bunch of small groups and in makeshift tents that vendors put up. There are a whole bunch of these scattered about a piece of land. There are a lot of people. I’m not there to particularly attend. It’s a program of events going on. Each tent has something else going on in it. I seem to be doing my own thing. As I’m walking down the middle of all these tents, I see one with a person leading a discussion. I see one of my son’s friend’s moms, Melissa. She’s Noah’s mom. She’s sitting and listening, attending one of these discussions. I go in and sit down. The leader of the discussion is telling people that shows of emotion are problematic and that people who do this are making social issues seem worse than they actually are, even small things like using two exclamation marks and spamming emojis contribute to this exaggeration of emotion. The lecturer is pointing how this is bringing the whole of society down. And then the lecturer points out: “Here are ways you can change your overly emotional behavior and start to tone it down, keep it small, don’t react.” The lecturer doesn’t actually have a gender, they are androgenous. They say, “And this is how you can keep it out of your face.” I look over at Melissa and I notice that her face looks so much more serious, and she normally looks very expressive and happy. The lecture is over now. I linger waiting to speak with her. Of course she sees me, but doesn’t react and walk over. So I go over and sit with her. I’m asking her: “Are you buying into this? What do you think?” She says, “Oh, I’ve been doing this for some time now.” She shows me a couple examples of her recent writing. Then she tells me that she is also practicing it in terms of celibacy. She hasn’t had any “action” in quite a few months. I say, “Well, maybe that’s making it easier to be less emotional and less expressive, but when you do have intimacy and share with someone again, you’re going to have an outpouring of emotions into your body. That’s a good thing!” I’m trying to argue that there are times when emotions fill your body and you feel more alive and expressive, and other times when they flatline, but sticking with one extreme is the problem, not the fact that you have emotions. She’s disagreeing with me and reiterating what the lecturer said. So I’m thinking, “Oh no, this is not good.” I feel this outpouring of compassion and wonder if other people are buying into this and just at a low point in their life where there isn’t anything to be outrageously happy about. I’m also thinking that the lecturer did have a point and that’s why so many people are believing this. Melissa is a very intelligent woman. I think there has to be a grain of truth, or they wouldn’t be able to pull so many people into this. It’s the fact that mass mania can get carried away with violence and that does hurt people. But it’s not emotions, but unconscious engagement with emotions and harmful actions. So now people that have been hurt are vulnerable to thinking that emotions themselves are wrong. I’m pondering this as I get up and start walking back through this alley of tents. Suddenly I’m at home. I’m in the living room. The living room is a mess and the furniture is all over the place. I start to straighten it, but I want to put it in a different arrangement and am trying to figure out how I can still have different areas for quiet, eating, and reading, but not in the same arrangement as before. But the shape of my living room is really odd and it’s hard to get furniture in with any sense of feng shui or flow. So as I’m pondering this and moving pieces around, I notice there are clothes strewn around. I’m picking them all up and putting them in a basket and taking them downstairs to sort out for a load of laundry. I have some delicate stuff in one load that is lighter, and saving the load of colors and towels and jeans that can take more agitation in another pile. Then I decide that instead of having two loads with lighter colors and darker colors, I’m really going to sort it according to delicate and able to withstand agitation. So, at the last minute, I throw a bunch of things in with the white delicates. I’ve got orange and blue in there now. I’m not concerned that the colors are going to run. I turn the temperature down and start the load of laundry.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,27/6/2020
27,,27/1/2020,"“Survival Juice” This dream begins with me driving through the town I lived in with my biological mother. I’m making a circle around the downtown area. I’ve driven down Kent St and have turned left onto William, then turn right on Russell, left on Lindsey St, left on Kent and right on William. Then I turn the car around so I’m traveling back up William to Kent St. I turn left on Kent, left on Lindsey St and then go behind the stores to a little parking lot and leave my car there. Now I’m on foot and I have both of my kids. I walk back through the same route. As I’m going past a building on William St, I tell my kids that it used to be an old hotel that dates back to the time of the Orangemen and the structure of it at the very bottom is based in intolerance and hate and that I believe it has influenced every other business that has been built on top of it since the late 1800s. A man is listening or he just overhears and argues. He says, “There was nothing there before the 1970s. I tell him, “No, that’s incorrect. I worked here for a very short period of time a long, long time ago. I’ve seen those exact roots.” When I’m saying “roots” I’m picturing old brick at the bottom that I’ve seen with my own eyes. He contradicts me and says that isn’t so. I just walk away because I know there’s no point arguing with somebody who doesn’t know anything and who’s like that. He sits down at this patio table with two of his friends and the server brings out three burgers and they all have a different kind of topping and they all have a different name. She names them as she lays them down on the table. I look and see they are all just burgers. We continue on foot around the route I already described. When we get to the back of the storefronts where I parked the car, I ask my kids if they’re hungry because we’ve been walking around and it’s quite hot out. They say they do. I take them to this tiny place up the street that serves fish and chips. Then, the dream shifts. I’m making up something I call “Survival Juice.” I’ve got these big glass carboys (jugs). I’m putting a lot of roots into them - some I chop first and some I just stuff down through the hole at the top. It’s a cloudy light beige color liquid. I simply describe it as “Survival Juice” - it’s a medicinal mixture I’ve made that is going to help us get through what we’re going through right now. I hand out a cup of it to each of my kids as well as the people at the restaurant.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,29/6/2020

It’s not clear where I’m going except that once we get onto the plane, I see this mental map of where it’s going and what countries I’m passing. It feels like we’re on our way to New Zealand. At the airport, I don’t realize that we have to take some kind of shuttle. I’m unclear as to why we have to take a shuttle when we’re already at the airport. However, it’s included with our ticket. We wait in this line. There are six of us and tons of other people. It’s packed. I guess there’s a number of shuttles because we wait, the crowd moves, we wait again, the crowd moves. So, as we are moving again I’m thinking, “Okay, this time we’re actually going to get on the shutte.” The shuttle is shaped like a mini airplane. The cockpit area is very short and then there is a little bit wider area. The seats in the cockpit area are like parallel parking - there are five on each side and once you get in, you’d be facing each other. Then the seats are more facing forward like an actual airplane with two and an aisle and two more. They’re facing the cockpit. I get separated from my friends because there are only five seats in the cockpit area. I have to sit in the first row of seats facing forward. I look over and who sits beside me but Donald Trump. I am completely horrified. I’m trying to squish myself as close to the side of the plane as I can. I’m just in shock, thinking: “How did this happen, how did this happen, how did this happen?” I keep thinking I'm In a plane but it’s taxiing down a major highway. I’m so invested in the idea that it’s a plane and it’s taxiing that when we’re going through traffic, I’m thinking the wings are going to be clipped off. I have to keep reminding myself that we’re not on the plane yet. Because I’m sitting beside Donald Trump, there are reporters and people with cameras and other people behind us that are trying to take pictures. That’s why I’m trying to shrink away from him - I don’t want to be in the picture, I don’t want it to look like I’m with him at all. The side of my leg is exposed. I’m horrified that he’s going to look at this and even maybe try to touch it. So again I keep trying to squish further and further away from him. The people that are sitting across the aisle from us, I realize I know the woman from somewhere. She says, “Freya?” I look over and see that I do know her but I can’t remember from where. I say, “Yes.” She’s sitting with a young man and I say, “Oh is this your son?” She says it is. He’s rolling his eyes. I’m thinking that he’s doing this because he thinks I’m with Donald Trump. Then, I’m telling my friends: “Can’t you please make any more room for me?” That’s when Donald Trump says my name and says, “Oh it’s okay, Freya.” That’s when I look down and notice that part of my thigh is exposed. It’s awful. I sit back in my seat because there’s no room. I look and see there are even more than five people stuffed into the cockpit. Then I hear the sound like in an old movie when a photo’s been taken, or maybe it’s from a cartoon...I’m like, “Oh my god, what if I’m in a picture with him?” The little mini airplane keeps going. It finishes its circuit and finally ends up at the airplane on the tarmac. We’re starting to get out. Donald Trump asks me: “When will we see each other again?” I’m thinking, “Oh my god! This is such a nightmare!” I just don’t answer and I’m trying to rush away and I’m trying to catch up with my friends. I’m saying to them, “Don’t leave me with that guy!” We get on the airplane. He’s gone. The airplane goes down a really long, long, long runway. As I look out the window to the left of me, I see all these strange plastic toys. They’re human-sized. There are people in them. They are powered by propulsion, so you have to get some kind of human speed or endeavor in order to get it to move through the water and then it will move on its own. So as we pass by, there’s this one person with mixed features that looks androgynous. All that is exposed out of the surface of the water is their face. Their expression is one of determined defeat or resignation and acknowledgement of defeat. There’s another one exactly the same as the first - same kind of features and exact same plastic vehicle apparatus, only it’s now in the air. Once they get up in the air, the thing keeps flying and going and the person can relax. I also note that these look like plastic bathtub toys. We taxi by a lot of these. They are all very bright in color - pink and green, pale orange, pale blue, and pale yellow. The plane finally takes off. We pass by this other person who is in this plastic version of what the first airplane looked like with the wings sticking out and canvas on them like Icarus would have used. The person has to use their own foot power to get it off the ground. That’s when I see that we’re flying over South America. The plane goes from North America down to South America, then it goes towards the East. I see us going across the Atlantic Ocean. Then it goes up again over Africa and I get a really close look of the Middle East. I start to notice things about the Middle East that I’ve never seen before. Then it veers away and starts to go south and east again over India and towards the Philippines. That’s when I think we’re going to New Zealand.",Dreamer 3,Freya,election,30/6/2020
29,,29/1/2020,"“The Gym” I’m in a really big gymnasium. It’s so crowded I can’t see anything. I can’t see the floor or the equipment. I’m supposed to be teaching in a few hours. I go outside the building to get some air. I notice that I’m really depressed. I was depressed in the gym. I’m depressed outside. I feel detached from all the people around me. I don’t want to be there. The air is dusty and feels dirty. Then my brother swings by to where I’m standing. He asks if I can help him out for a few minutes. I say, “Well I have to be back here at 7 to teach.” He says, “That’s fine. We’ll be back in plenty of time.” I get in the car with him. Immediately, it’s like he’s driving with this really rash intent to get somewhere really quickly. I feel the car is moving more quickly than is safe. Immediately he goes right onto a 7-lane highway. He races over and we stop at a gas station parking lot and there’s a trailer. He asks me if I will hook the trailer to the ball and hitch at the back of the car. I say, “Sure.” I get out of the car. I pick up the end of the trailer with the female end. I think, “Hmm, I wonder if I can lift this without him.” It lifts really easily and I think it’s odd because it should be heavier than this. As I go to attach it to the male end at the back of the car, I notice both ends are made of plastic and realize that’s why it felt too light. As I set the female part on top of the male part, there’s a little cap that’s not quite big enough to reach over the top of the ball. There’s no resounding click when it makes contact. There’s no side pinions that go down through the top to the bottom like there normally would be. Of course, they would have been made of metal, but they’re not. As I’m doing this, I’m picturing the metal one and what the parts and pieces would look like. I’m thinking, “Oh no. This is not good.” I yell into my brother, “Do you know this is made of plastic?” He says, “Yes. It will be fine. Don’t worry about it.” I detach and reattach it a couple of times. I tug on it with my hands. I’m still really dubious about this. He keeps telling me, “Come on, we have to go.” I think, “Well okay, he must have done this before because he moves a lot of things with trailers, so I guess I’m just going to have to trust him.” I get back in the car. He starts to take off. I notice that the trailer isn’t attached and I tell him this. He stops and tells me to go back out, pull the trailer back up and reattach it. I’m still saying, “The whole thing is plastic. This isn’t going to stay on your car when you’re speeding on the highway.” He says, “Yes it will.” I get out and do what he asks me to do - pull the trailer back on, pull the flimsy cap back over. I get back in the car and this time it actually says. He zooms on the highway. We pull off on the other side to this industrial air. The dusty dirty air now has grease molecules in it. It smells like petroleum. I stay in the car. He gets out and quickly loads something onto the trailer. He turns the car and trailer around, and sometimes it stays attached. Now it has heavy things in it. But we zoom back to the highway and zoom back to the gym where he drops me off. I have ten minutes before I have to teach. Luckily, the people have started to leave, so there’s a window before the other people arrive for what I’m teaching. I see what they have for equipment. I’m teaching Pilates. I see they have the thicker mats stacked up and the bender balls you squeeze. I tell the people waiting for the class to get a mat and a ball and set themselves up. I have five minutes until class starts. I walk across to the storeroom to see what they’ve got. I find those rubber resistance bands and gliders for moving planks. I think that’s good for next time and I’ll just go with the bender balls and thick mats because it’s only a half hour class. I go back out. People are set up on their mats. Other people have come in and set up stationary bikes between the mats. I’m thinking that this is not safe. I look around and there are so many people that I can’t see who's in charge. I can’t see the clock, either. I just start my class. I take them into one series of exercises. Everybody is responding super super slowly. The bicycle people keep getting in the way. I look at the clock and my class is over already, but we haven’t even done anything. This brings that really heavy depressed, pointless, going nowhere dejection back into my body again. The people stack their mats on the side. There’s no interaction between the students and me. They’re like zombies. I’m going back to the storeroom to put the equipment away. There is a mirror and I look at myself. My face was infected with pus on the forehead, under my left eye, on my left cheekbone, and from the top of the left side of my forehead across to the middle. I’m looking for something to soak up the pus. I can’t find anything. Then I go back out. This other instructor who normally teaches yoga is trying to teach the people on the stationary bikes to do yoga on top of the bikes. I just wonder what’s wrong with everything. I don’t like this environment and don’t want to be part of it.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,5/7/2020
30,,30/1/2020,"“The Long Night” I’m riding my bike. I put a few things in my backpack. I notice that I’m wearing long pants and a long sleeved shirt. It’s dark. I ride my bike all the way from one end of town to the other. The town ends. I keep riding. I come to the home of my daughter’s boyfriend’s parents. I stop there for a little bit. The mom’s sister is there, too. I feel detached from them in some way. I think they’re talking about something that’s racist. Because I’m kind of detached, they don’t really care if I’m there or not. I get back on my bicycle and leave. I keep riding. It’s still dark. I’m getting tired. Then I stop at a building. I go in. Inside are the studio owners of a place I used to teach at, but don’t anymore because of their unethical way of scheduling their staff. The building isn’t a studio though, it’s just this long building. They both appear to be busy with other tasks. The building is a long rectangle. I think I’m just there to rest. There isn’t anything in it. I’m not talking to the owners, I'm just standing there. Suddenly there’s a counter, like you’d see at a bank. They’re each on one side of the counter. A woman comes up to the counter. Now I’m on the same side as one of them. She is busy and writing in some kind of big ledger. The woman asks a question. Now I see that I have some tickets in my hand. I tell her that it’s a raffle for my son’s hockey team. She says, “Oh, in that case, I’ll buy tickets.” I’m writing her name on them and then ripping them out of the booklet. I hand her the tickets and say, “He’s also in theatre. I know it’s an odd combination - hockey and theatre.” She says, “No, my son does the same thing. It’s nice to have boys who are interested in both.” We start talking together and leave. I realize I need to use the washroom. I go into the washroom and the other woman does, too. She’s in the stall next to me. I’m getting toilet paper off the roll on the wall, but it’s not really toilet paper. It’s actually thick towels. I hear her say, “Do you have any extra?” I say, “Yes, one moment.” I’m getting some off the roll for her. It takes a little while because they are thick towels. As I turn to hand her a bunch, her face is through the wall as though the wall is made of soup, or the way it is in movies like a quantum wall. Her face, which I don’t seem to have noticed before, is very white and her hair is really thin and damp and lank. I hand her the towels and both of her hands are through the wall that partitions the stalls and she takes it. She disappears and finishes whatever she’s doing. I hear her leave. I’m standing at the sink washing my face. I’m wondering if I’m going to be cold because it’s getting colder as the night progresses. I get back on my bike and I’m really cold and my legs are tired. I don’t know where else there is to go. I wonder if a bus comes out this far and if I can put my bicycle on the bus. But then I look down and see that I have no purse and no wallet. I realize I can’t get on a bus. I turn my bike to go back in the opposite direction I’ve come from. I’ve come a really long way. I notice as I ride by, a platform that comes to a point like a triangle. It has asphalt on the top and a curb on either side. A girl is standing on it, as if it’s a bus stop out in the middle of nowhere. I ask her if she’s waiting for a bus. She says, “I’ve been standing here a really, really long time and no bus has come.” I tell her, “I don’t think buses come out this far.” She says, “Are you going back towards town?” I say, “Yes.” She says, “Well let’s walk together.” I get off my bike. My legs are tired of peddling anyway. I walk beside her. We walk in silence for a really long, long time. Then I ask her if she doesn’t mind telling me which end of town she lives. She says she lives in the west end. We’re still quite a bit towards the east. I say, “Oh so do I.” We have to walk all the way through town to get there. I wonder, “Maybe we can share a taxi?” She says, “I don’t have my money with me.” I say, “Right, neither do I.” We’re walking and walking. Then we get to the outskirts of town finally and I notice the sun is starting to come up. She says, “Oh, I have a room here at this end. Why don’t we stop here and rest a bit.” We go in. it’s just a room in a really old house that’s seen better years. The front door opens. Inside is a really long high ceiling. There’s a couch to sit on and I immediately go to the couch and sit. There’s some kind of little table, but it’s not really a table. It’s like two wooden boxes stacked on top of each other, about one foot by one foot square, and tall. She has some things on it - little tiny containers. She says to me: “This wallpaper has been bugging me for a really long time. I think I want to take it down.” I notice that the wall is a homemade checkerboard. She tells me the landlord did it himself. There’s a pale green paint on the wall. He’s made the checkerboard out of wallpaper and paint squares alternating. The part made of wallpaper is really interesting with white and colors - light blue and orange watercolor wash. She says, “I don’t know how he did this, or I would paint over it.” I get up from the couch to take a good look. I say, “Hmm, it looks like there’s some kind of pigment in the paint that as he applied it with the roller, it was heat activated and the color pigments expanded and bled into each other.” She says, “Hmm maybe you’re right.” But as I look deeper into it, I see that it’s made of a whole bunch of different scraps of wallpaper that he’s somehow laid on top of each other. There are layers and layers and layers. It looks like multicolor paint, but it’s these layers and layers of colored wallpaper scraps. Then I see that it’s only thumbtacked to the wall. I say, “Look. It’s starting to come off at the corners, so you can just take the whole thing off.” So she starts to take the thumbtacks out and puts them in the little containers on the wooden crate table. Underneath that are more colors of wallpaper and layers. She’s happy with it, but it’s the same thing underneath, so that’s interesting. As she’s doing this, a woman comes in with her young son. The young boy didn’t really look like his mom. The mom’s face was round like the moon. His head was longer and narrow. I remember thinking that he was such an interesting combination of features. He was halfway in between the washed out color of Heather and the vibrant darker color of his mom. I realize this is a daycare. The woman addresses the person I was walking with as Heather. For the first time I notice that Heather is kind of washed out. She has features, but they don’t stand out from her skin very much. It’s hard to see what she looks like. I notice she has paler skin and freckles and this pale mousy brown hair. The woman asks Heather: “Do you believe in conspiracies?” I notice that one of the checkerboards has the word, “conspiracy” written on it. Heather replies, “Yes.” The woman who enters says, “Good. I’ll be back soon for my son.” Then she gets in her car. The wall of the building has disappeared. She tells me to hop in the back. The car looks like a Model-T Ford. There’s a newer model car that imitates its look with the wide panels. The car is made of wood. The back part has a little rumble seat and she indicates I should sit there. I notice the woman’s skin is a deep brown. She’s wearing a fantastical hat. Her dress is a pale mauve and it’s ethereal and floats like a Great Gatsby dress. She’s wearing round John Lennon glasses. I get in the rumble seat. She starts the car and I say, “Are you sure this car will make it?” She says, “There’s nothing wrong with this car at all.” She drives it through the house, which has gelatinous quantum type walls and doors. We go out to the back and there’s hay on the ground. There’s a barn, but we’re in an old urban city area, turn of the century with row houses that went up really fast to house people who worked in factories. But there’s a barn! It’s really unconducive to the rest. She says, “This is one of the only barns left in this town.” She parks the car and we get out. The woman disappears and now I go back into the house from the back. Heather and the young boy are in the only other room in the building - it’s a kitchen. I start putting food together. I look in the cupboards. There’s something that’s corn-based, like a ground up corn. The other ingredients are really odd and I don’t think it will go together. I also notice that it’s safe for me to eat because it’s all corn-based. I start mixing something up. As I’m adding water, it turns into other ingredients. We eat. I tell them - Heather and the young boy - that it’s time for me to go now because I really need to get back to my own house. I leave. It’s warmer now and I feel a little rested. I finish the journey to my own home.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,7/7/2020
31,,31/1/2020,"“Mayoral Politic” This dream is more of a thematic than a narrative. It looked like one of those old fashioned great big signs when you enter a town where it has the mayor’s face on it, then a story about the town. It was like a threshold or portal or lived experience rather than just a great big giant sign. It looked old, too, it had an oval shape to the story, the painted picture of the mayor was in the upper left hand side. I’m looking at a description, but it’s also an entry into a town. So it’s not two-dimensional. On the description is a comparison of a mayor and the lifestyle of someone involved in a subculture and has a motorcycle. The mayor is female. She looks like she’s had a life of outdoors - there’s a sun-kissed color to her skin. She has short blonde wavy and dense hair. She looks like she would be a muscular person even though the picture only has her face. The description is like a political analysis of someone who is mayor of a town and removed from that duty that caters to the idea of mayor but stays in the office and doesn’t really interact - maybe like how clueless the aristocracy was to the plight of the common people. So it’s a comparison between mayoral duties that are detached and removed from what people need as opposed to someone who is more rebellious of that polite culture, rides a motorcycle, but is simultaneously responsive to the needs of the town and then is praised. But the praise is lie: despite the fact that there is a motorcycle, there are a number of positive qualities that the mayor has. It’s not two-dimensional in that I’m reading this. I’m feeling it as a lived experience in my body when these two descriptions are compared and contrasted. It’s like an entryway into that experience. I consider them from how my body feels about them, then decide that I would rather live in a place with a mayor that rides a motorcycle and is somewhat rebellious but responsive, than the mayor that caters to polite society but is cluelessly privileged.",Dreamer 3,Freya,election,19/7/2020
32,,1/2/2020,"“Grapefruits in Church and Racecars in the Water” This dream starts in my house. It’s not the house I currently live in; it’s not a house I’m familiar with at all. I’m in the kitchen and my daughter is with me. We are talking as though we haven't been anywhere in a long time. We are aware that there is a church nearby and lots of people have given us good feedback on it and we know that the group that goes there is really involved in a lot of things in the community. So even though church has not been something that we’ve had favorable ideas about in the past, we decide to give it a try. It’s Sunday. We walk to the church. The church is enormous. It’s beautiful. It’s built of stone; it looks like hand-hewn rock. It rises really high up into the sky. On the front of it, there is a really large stained glass window in the shape of a rose. There are spires around the outside of it that also rise straight up. The doors are all hewn wood. The wood is so thick and the doors are bigger than normal. This is what you see from the outside. The church probably takes up a whole block. The doors are open. People are starting to file in. The faces aref friendly. There is such a multicultural, multi demographic of people of gender and age and they just reflect such a wide variety of life. My daughter and I look at each other; we smile, but we don’t say anything. We’re thinking, “Yep, this is going to be good.” We go in. There’s an older woman who is taking people’s names. She’s asking questions about our interest. She notes these on a clipboard then directs us to go upstairs. She also tells which room to go to when the service is over. She is clumping people by interest. We walk up a really wide staircase - it’s probably three staircases wide - and it creaks under my feet. The creaking is like an orchestra because there are a lot of people and as each person’s foot lands on the stairs, the stairs make a creak. So it’s a symphony of creaks. The staircase winds around. I can feel the vibration of people’s creaking steps overtop my head. It takes a while to go up the stairs and finally we get to the top. We’re in the balcony of the church. We know which pew to sit in - I guess she’s told us. So we sit and the wood is really dark - it’s like a black walnut dark. It’s hard to see who else is sitting there because we blend into the wood. As my eyes adjust to the darkness, I can see the silhouette of other people’s shoulders and heads in the pews in front of us. It’s not really crowded up here. There is a lot of space between the pews and I notice that there are leaves or something between the pews in the balcony. I can also see the leaves in the front of the balcony - where the balcony ends and there should be a big open space because there are pews down below, the leaves keep going. As I stare into them, I see lighter colors and a tree growing in between and fruit of some sort. A couple people are picking the fruit and passing them to each other. So whoever is picking them in the leaves beyond the balcony, I don’t know what they’re standing on. I realize what they’re tossing to people in the balcony is the biggest grapefruit I’ve ever seen in my entire life - they’re the size of basketballs. It seems to be organized so the people who are plucking them are tossing them to people who are collecting them. I feel that the pew underneath me is starting to move, so it’s moving sideways and then picking up speed. It goes all the way across the church and then like a rollercoaster, it goes down rapidly. I think I’m on a rollercoaster, but it’s moving through the church. I can see the track that it’s on and it ends after the first downward slope. I think there’s no track after that and we’re going to stop too abruptly and fly out of this and get hurt. But we don’t. There is no whiplash and no ramification in my body from having stopped that abruptly at all. Then everybody in that pew gets out and starts climbing back up. So my daughter and I do the same thing. It’s as though this has happened many times before. No one is surprised; no one is shocked. As soon as everyone is out, the pew slowly recedes back up the big slope and back into position. That’s where everybody is going. So we’re new and we follow the crowd. It’s a steep slope to climb up and I have to use my hands as well as my feet. I think the floor is slippery and I’ll slide backwards, but I don’t. The floor is made out of these round river rocks about the size of my palm. I can feel that the water has molded the shape of these rocks. They are of many different colors like the bottom of a stream in northern Canada. So there’s granite and pinks and greys from unaged granite like a limestone, and the pinks and blacks from millenia aged granite. So we climb back up and there’s just enough curvature in these stones that your hands and fingers and toes fit in them nicely. We walk back up. Now the pew is back in its spot, so we sit there. Now my eyes feel lighter. I look up and see that the whole top of the church is glass and open to the sky. The leaves I saw before were sitting in the top of a tree. The sermon that I thought would be delivered is not really. It’s just people sitting up there receiving the top of the tree, the sky. And now the pew I’m sitting in, I realize it’s not just made of wood, but under my feet is deep dark rich earth. There are more than just grapefruits here. There are other fruits. I can see something red and wonder if it’s mango or plum. There is also walnut. We’re up here to harvest. My daughter and I start to pluck and we know it’s okay to just pick what is ripe. The things I thought were grapefruit, I’m not sure that they are now. The unripe ones are yellow and as people pick them, they turn a deep dark ruby red. But they are the size of a basketball and the skin feels like a grapefruit skin. Now we have crates. I’ve noticed that we’re only picking a little from each thing. Then people start standing up and going back down the really wide staircase. So my daughter and I follow. We’ve picked some things, too. I can still feel the residue and can smell the things we picked - it’s on the skin of my hands and it smells so good. My feet feel the fertility of that black earth underneath as we walk. So we go back down the staircase. I feel really full, vibrant, alive, sensuous. People are dividing off into different rooms. The room we end up in is one where people are packing a lunch because we’re going down to the water to meet at the dock. My daughter and I are a little confused. We think we were supposed to have brought food but we didn’t. Then I notice a kitchen and people are going in there. I think: “Have we contributed to this in some way?” So there’s a little bit of confusion in my mind about whether or not we can help ourselves to the food to make our lunch or if we’re just supposed to help make it or if we’ve contributed to it already. Then during this confusion with people packing lunches and stuff, I see I have a thermal bag and we do have food in it. We have sandwiches and some hard boiled eggs. I zip it up and sling it over my shoulder. Again there’s this organic flow of movement that we follow with people. It leads out of the church and down to the water. During this time, my memory returns back to the woman at the door. I’m asking her if she knows where we’re supposed to be at what time. She says, “Oh yes, I still have that information, it’s just not at my fingertips. Because I haven’t seen you in a long time, I put it over here. But I thought you’d be back.” That’s just a memory. Then the people we’re with and my daughter and I are now down at the dock. We’ve walked down this path from the church - it’s a dirt path that’s wide and more like an outskirts of the city path. We aren’t in an urban area. It’s like non-urbanized, but we’re not in the woods because there’s grass and stuff. When we get to the dock there is an eclectic collection of boats; some are covered and I can’t see what they are. It’s not just a dock, it’s an organized pier with different fingers on it. There seems to be more fingers on the right and just a few on the left and a main pier going down the center. As we are walking, the crowd of people we’ve left from the church with break out into smaller groups. Then, my daughter and I are in a group with just four or five people. I see in one of the groups, a guy I know. He lives where I do and used to be a friend, but I’ve recently noted that he’s involved in this conspiracy group and they’re campaigning for people not to wear masks and the idea that the pandemic has been a hoax - a government trick to take away our rights. He’s posting things with known conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers like Andrew Wakefield and stuff. So I see him but his face is frozen in a fake smile. He goes over to another pier with a few people. They get into a motorboat with triple engines. They take the cloth off and there are fumes and they speed away. It makes a really sound like a muscleman car with a hole cut in the hood and the engine raised with tripe carbonators and it’s so deafening you can't hear anything else. The people we’re with take the cloth off the boat. I’m happy to see it’s a sailboat. Then an older man in the group says to me: “You know how to sail this, you know how to operate this boat, right?” I say, “I do, but it’s not mine. Whose boat is it?” He says, “It’s okay, we can all use it. I have permission.” I’m feeling really uncomfortable that the person who owns the boat isn’t here and this other person who I don’t know and have just met today and been divided into a group with is saying that it’s okay to use it. He reassures me, but I’m so hesitant about just taking off in this boat. I explain to him that I’m not going to do it until I know the owner, who is a woman, says it’s okay. He says, “Okay,” then leaves. My daughter and I are on the sailboat. It’s a 28 foot sailboat. The equipment for starting it is in a little different place than I’ve seen before. So I start looking around the boat and locate where everything is. I’m checking out the rigging.There’s a series of about eight flip switches in a double row - the kind that are like a little nipple but made of metal and switch on and off. They’re underneath the gunnels on the port side of the boat. I can feel them with my fingers and am thinking it’s a weird place to have this because normally they’re where you can see because you need to flip the batteries on and off every time - you have to flip on the radio then turn it off when you leave. So I can’t see what the operate. I’m trying to figure this out. The ship’s wheel is also really weird. Normally small sailboats just have a tiller. As I’m looking at it I’m thinking that this is like a combination of a motorboat and sailboat, which is really odd. Then, that makes me wonder. We get out of that boat and I’m looking around at the others. There are race cars under some of the cloths - they’re not even ships at all, but they’re bobbing up and down so they’re floating somehow. This is really weird. So now I’m off the boat of the woman who I didn’t know. The rest of the group who was supposed to sail has gone. I think that’s okay because I didn’t think we were supposed to take out a boat of someone we don’t know anyway. Then I see a boat that belongs to someone I do know but he’s not there. So I text him and ask him if he’s going to be sailing today. He says, “Yes. Just wait there and I’ll be down at my boat in a moment.” My daughter and I wait. We’re getting hungry so I open up the thermal bag and we divide up our lunch. We’re just in the process of eating when I see the owner of the boat come down the pier. He says, “Okay, are you guys ready to go?” We say yes. The door to his boat is slanted away from the pier - not unusual for a sailboat - but as he takes the teak board off the door, it’s right up against the dock and as we look in, it’s so deep that it’s black - you can’t see anything. The bow extends outwards from the dock and it’s so long I can’t see the end. It’s enormous. Unfortunately, that’s when I wake up.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,23/7/2020
33,,2/2/2020,"“Eyes” All I remember is my face. My face is obscured behind some kind of shield that leaves only my eyes exposed. I’m looking at myself. My eyes are rounder and they’re sunken way back into my head. It’s like I have no eyebrows and now eyelashes. They’re just sunken. Yet at the same time, they seem to be outlined with makeup or some kind of eyeliner just around the lids. The face shield is not right on my face; it’s an inch away from my face. It’s made out of hard material like a lampshade would have been made of. It’s kind of waxed.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,5/8/2020
34,,3/2/2020,"“The Cold Water” I’m in a large ranch style log house. There is a lot of iron made stuff and stuff made out of wood. There are really old fashioned cooking implements nailed to the wall. There are farming pieces and sides all made of iron and hand-hammered - you can see the little pound marks and everything. It stretches from the eating area through what would be the kitchen area into a longer gathering place where there are other rooms that are dark - I can’t see what’s in them but I think they are bedrooms. I’m standing in that area. I’ve walked in through the front door, through the parlor, through the kitchen area, and now I’m standing in the back parlor. Other people are there and in my dream I know them but I don’t recognize them with my conscious mind to give them a name now. They’re dressing in various kinds of wetsuits. They have diving equipment and masks. Some of the wetsuits are the short ones, some are longer in the leg. The idea is to go out snorkeling or diving into the stream that runs on the property behind the ranch house. I feel like I’m ready to go and I’m confident. So, I walk out and it’s winter. There’s snow on the ground. I walk out the door along the snow, along the bank of the river, until I get to the point where it’s been decided that I will enter. Everyone is entering at a different place. I start to climb down a river bank that’s probably about four feet high. I’m backing down on my stomach. Where my feet are supposed to hit solid ground, they don’t. It breaks from underneath the weight of my body, but there’s so much of my body already over the embankment that I can’t pull myself back up and I just slip down into the freezing icy cold water. I’m trying to shout for help. I can feel my limbs starting to freeze. But nothing comes out of my throat. I keep trying to shout louder but my voice won’t obey my emotion. I’m trying to say help and I’m trying to say I’m cold, but nothing comes out. I can see people around me but they aren’t noticing that I’ve broken through the surface and I’m sinking.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,11/8/2020
35,,4/2/2020,"“The Line Up” I’m in a doctor’s office but it’s actually some kind of ear specialty clinic. I’ve had an issue with my ears. My appointment was for 8am. I get there and am with a friend, a female friend. We’re sitting on a bench outside of the office. There’s a parallel line up, not part of the ear clinic but beside it where people are lined up to pay their gas bill. Their line up goes all the way down the sidewalk, wraps around the bottom of the hill where the traffic lights are and continues down the other side of the road and around the buildings then vanishes out of sight. I comment that if it weren’t traffic, the line would be graceful as it wraps around the urban setting. I comment to my friend that what we’re looking at is the demographic of people who don’t believe in paying their bills online or don’t trust banks. She makes some kind of argument but I can’t remember what it is now. I debate back that yes, I see your point but we’re still looking at that demographic. I try and study it. I'm looking at the pole., their faces, what they’re wearing, and trying to listen to snippets of their conversation. It’s mostly elderly people. But there’s also a middle aged group of scruffy looking men. I notice millennials there as well. Then our number gets called and we enter the ear clinic. We have another line up in there. It’s now 11:30am and my appointment was scheduled for 8. I’m starting to get hungry and feel frustrated. Then it’s 3pm. I’m still not there. There are about four people ahead of me and I know the clinic closes at 5. I approach the desk and say, “My appointment was at 8. It’s 3pm. I’m really getting tired and hungry and thirsty. What's going on?” The receptionist who looks like my son’s counselor crawls underneath the desk and speaks to me from there. She says, “I’m really sorry. This isn’t by my design. People get upset by this all the time. They do this every time. Everyone’s appointment was scheduled for 8am.” I feel like screaming at her but I don’t. I tell her that I understand it’s not her fault, but inside I’m frustrated and angry. I’m dizzy and starting to get a headache. I go back and sit down. Now it’s almost 5pm. There is a person that does the procedure I came for and I know they tend to leave a little bit earlier than the rest of the staff. I go back to the desk and say, “Am I still going to be able to get this done today?” She says, “Well, you have two choices. You can wait until we open in the morning or I can give you this syringe and you can inject yourself at home. You still have to wait for your appointment.”I have this dissonance between my inner landscape which is angry and frustrated and tired and hungry and thirsty with what I’m saying to her. I tell her I’ll take the syringe full of medicine. Then I say, “Well wait a sec, if I have to stay anyways, is she going to be back tomorrow?” She tells me she is. I say, “Well nevermind then, I might as well wait and have her do it properly since I have to stay here overnight anyway.” She hands it to me anyway, and says, “Well take it just in case.” She hands me a syringe full of liquid medicine. I go back and realize that while I’ve been talking to her, someone who arrived after me has gone in and got their appointment. I’m unbelievably agitated. I also realize this is just great, I’m going to have to stay overnight because you’re not allowed to go home. If you go home they put you back in the line up, so it’s a never ending cycle of having to wait from 8am until the end of the day when they can’t even take you. I push two chairs together and try and stretch my body across the chairs. My friend is doing the same thing. We take off our coats and use them as pillows and lie down. The night passes with me not being able to sleep because I’m too hungry and too thirsty. I wish I had water. I’m feeling that restlessness in your legs from not getting enough exercise. So, I start to walk around the building. I walk around twenty times and then come back in and it’s past midnight. I get back in the chairs and go to sleep. I sleep for maybe five minutes and am woken up. Some part of the chair is sticking in my back - it’s wooden and pressing in my thigh so I feel like I’m getting a bruise. I stay awake until I see the morning light coming into the building. I sit up in my chair and see the people come back to the desk. I feel like threatening them somehow and saying I’d better be first! That’s when I wake up.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,8/9/2020
36,,5/2/2020,"“For a Little While” I’m in a village. It’s a small community. People live close to each other. There is not a lot of space. People don’t live in houses. It’s outside living. People’s space is defined by what they have in it, which is mostly contained to sleeping quarters and the belongings they have that are necessary for daily life. My area is quite comfortable. I’m happy with it. I feel content. My sleeping area is soft, spacious. The covers are warm; it’s under my head and supports it and I have plenty of it. I am walking through the village holding the hand of a small child. I’m walking slowly to adjust to her pace. My heart, my body is full of love for her. I’m waiting for her dad. I know he’s there but he’s invisible. He has a presence but I haven’t seen him with my eyes yet. The time goes very very fast. A number of days blend into one moment. At this particular moment in time, I feel someone around me and behind me on the path where we’re walking. Today he materialises. I see him in the flesh. I feel my own flesh respond to his physical presence. I’m really happy to see him. We walk together for some time, hand in hand, enjoying being on a walk in the body. Then the village gradually gets a little closer together as the sun sets in the sky. It’s time for us to return to the sleeping quarters. As we approach, there’s food you can eat with your fingers that’s warm and savory. We both unwrap a small package of food that maybe fits in your hand. We eat it with our fingers. The packages are like skins. We squeeze them shut and set them down around the boundaries of our sleeping area. The things we’ve stacked around the sleeping area - our belongings - give us just enough privacy. Everyone goes to their sleeping quarters at the same time so there’s privacy from everyone else’s eyes for everyone. I feel the anticipation of being able to share our bodies tonight. The experience is very electric and satisfying. It creates a feeling of zest to taste life again. Then as dreams do, some days pass by in the blink of an eye. Again, we are sharing our bodies in our sleeping area. But this time my young daughter is not going to sleep as much. Something is disturbing her sleep. Her dad cuddles her until she falls asleep then he moves her off his chest very slowly so as not to wake her, and sets her at one side of the sleeping area. As he turns towards me, she lifts her head and is awake. Then we switch places. He’s on the left of me and I rock her in the bed. She feeds on my breast. I slowly turn over to my right side. I can feel her mouth unlatch. I slowly try to lower her a little onto the softness of the bed then turn back toward him. But he seems to be involved with some other activity and rolls off the bed. He leaves for a moment and then comes back to the bed. He’s only there for a moment. This repeats in a pattern. Then when the sun rises, I can feel things grow lighter. I know he’s still there in spirit but in the flesh he’s been called for some other purpose. I get up. This time when my daughter and I walk the path, there is a younger child with curly dark hair who appears to be an orphan. No one knows who her parents are. My very young child grabs this child by the hand and now we’re walking even more slowly. The young one barely old enough to walk, staggers. Her eyes are big and wide and round. She’s looking around. I think to myself, “She’s looking for the parents she doesn’t have.” I know that we will look after her though. So, hands linked, we walk. Some of the other villagers are staring at us. I can tell they are processing that we have absorbed this orphan child. Their thoughts about that are clear on their faces. Others are too absorbed in their own work and are not even noticing. I’m happy to look after her. She’s a beautiful spirit. At the same time, I miss my daughter’s father. I miss that he can’t stay with us. I wish that his physical body was present. I miss the act of union.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,16/9/2020
37,,6/2/2020,"“Grief and Ash” I’m having a conversation with a woman that continues despite the fact that I need to use the washroom. It continues despite the fact that I’m sitting on the toilet and pushing something out of my body. I’m pushing shit out of my body. I don't have to strain too hard. My body does evacuate it pretty effortlessly. I can hear other people in the house but it’s more like white noise rather than distinct conversation. Then the person I’m talking to continues talking about mundane topics as though I’m not sitting on the toilet and I’m not evacuating shit from my body. I can feel my body is finished. Then I take the toilet paper from the roll on the wall, nothing unusual. As I try and wipe the remnants of it from myself, it feels like there’s gritty stuff like seeds. I wipe again. Now instead of there being less on the paper, there’s more. I repeat this process about six times. There’s more each time. I feel like it’s spreading it around the cheeks of my bum. And so, I think that this process is spreading it around me more. I don’t want to continue it. I need to go somewhere else where I can get clean. I tell the woman, “I can’t talk to you right now. I need to stop this.” She does leave. I take off all my clothes and get into the shower. I scrub myself from head to toe. I realize that the shower, the water, the soap is making me clean. I stop, rinse myself off and get out. I towel myself off. I feel clean now. But I’m disgusted at my clothes. I think they carry something. I put them in the washing machine in the bathroom, add some soap, turn the water on and start them. Then the dream continues on. I just can’t pull any more out of it.",Dreamer 3,Freya,environment,17/9/2020
38,,7/2/2020,"“The Scavenger Hunt” I’m in this outdoor space. It’s like a big hill. There are a lot of rocks on the hill. There is some low growing grass. It’s like rolling lowlands. There are some flat spaces but also lots of places to climb. The trees are more like evergreen trees; they’re conifers. I don’t recall any deciduous trees at all. I’m with some people. We are tasked with finding these red marks. Each red mark indicates that there’s something hidden there and we have to follow the instructions or use the thing that’s hidden for the purpose that it’s hidden for. There is a bit of gathering as we get into very small groups of just one or two people. Some people are going off on their own. At the bottom of the hill is some kind of night vision glass that if you look through it, you can see where the red marks are. You can’t see the marks unless you’re looking through the glass. So, you have to remember where they are then start to weave your way up the hill and climb over the rocks, sometimes on hands and knees. Some of it is really steep and people are grabbing onto immature trees to help pull themselves up. We don’t have any equipment. We’re wearing clothes and we have to figure out how to navigate through the landscape on our own. Then once you get there, you just feel around with your hand or look with your eyes to discern if there’s some item that’s not natural. Some of them are tricky. For example, one of the items is simply some food. So where the red dot was is a piece of fish food then close by to where it was found, the rock is like a mouth of a cave. We crawl in. Really close to the mouth of the cave is a deep, deep pool. There’s a large fish in there, probably about three feet long and has teeth. What’s the natural food you do with fish food if there’s a fish? Feed it. So, the person that I’m with feeds the fish. I think she better get her hand back quickly because that fish has a lot of rows of pointy teeth and it’s a carnivorous fish. She does. She feeds it. Then it submerges itself. Right after that, an even bigger fish starts swimming up to the surface. It’s about twelve feet long! We all start running out. It’s the mother. There was only one piece of food and we’re thinking that we might be the other food. Each one of these spots has hazards and the thing you’re supposed to solve. Some people are able to remember three red dots and they just keep moving back. Other people can only remember one at a time so they go back down to the bottom of the hill and look through the night vision glass again. One of these times when I go back down there Omar is there. We group together to do our scavenger hunt. We have to go quite far. It’s a lot farther out than some of the ones that are closeby. There is a long climb up a tree then you have to move from the tree onto a rock cliff face. We swing onto the rock. There’s a forest ranger lookout tower and we climb up it. He finds all this survival equipment - tiny packages of dehydrated food wrapped in plastic and shirts with long sleeves individually wrapped in plastic. They’re the kind of shirt that protects you from the sun. There are other things also wrapped in plastic. Because he got there first, he has this big box. Luckily I was there, too, because it’s really impossible to hold a box and climb back down to the night vision pane of glass. So he hands me the box, then climbs down, then I hand him the box and climb down. This is how we get down. Once we get down, he is tasked with needing to divide the contents of the box equally between all the participants of this scavenger hunt. While he’s doing this, I go and find more of the marks. When I come back, he’s finished the task. Apparently, it’s my job to disperse the packages he’s divided and give one to each person. For some reason, he’s written really, really tiny and the ink of the pen he was using is really blotchy and runs out sometimes. It’s really hard to read the names. I’m trying to guess some of them. I do. I have another pen and am writing on the top trying to fill in the blanks. It starts to get dark. There’s one more task to finish. I go up the hill to a grassy area. There’s a lawnmower. Those two things go together. What do you do with a lawnmower? You cut grass. Only it’s really tricky because the grass is growing on the side of a slope and it’s pretty much a vertical rise. That’s the only long grass. I’m trying to push the lawnmower up and then guide it back down so it doesn’t flip over and cut my feet with the blade. I do this. It’s dark. This man comes over and comments that I’ve done a good job. The other tricky part about doing this is that there are some plants - angel’s trumpet - growing on that slope. You wouldn’t cut that with your lawnmower. So I have to be careful to get the grass without damaging the angel's trumpet. I finish this and then leave the lawnmower. At this point, there’s some kind of alarm raised. Everybody is running. There is some chaos. I see someone I know. I run over to her and ask if she knows what’s going on. She’s not sure and says I should stay here. This is one of the flat spots, a plateau. Others are gathering here, too. I see Omar and realize I didn’t finish dispersing all the survival kits. I can feel the fear in people as we’re standing and waiting to see if we have eased the threat by finding the marks and solving the puzzles, doing what we need to do? This question is just hanging in there.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,17/9/2020
39,,8/2/2020,"“Gutting the Backpack - Lucid Dream” This is one of those lucid dreams where you just close your eyes for a moment and your body is rooted down despite the fact that you feel like you want to get up and move. I’m suddenly standing rooted on the side of a road. Suddenly a man appears and leaps over the shoulder and yanks something out from the forest at the side of the road. The forest goes right to the shoulder. He pulls out something that I at first think is an animal. And all in one second, he takes a knife out of his pocket and he guts it, making a long sharp blade from the top to the bottom. The contents spill out the way people do when they gut a shark and tires and all that kind of stuff from the bottom of the ocean that ends up in the belly of a shark pulls out on the side of the road. There’s liquid or digestive juices with it. I’m horrified for a moment, then I think: “Wait a minute, that’s not an animal, that’s a backpack!” The things that came out of it are equipment, like flashlights, a little rope and cans of emergency food. It’s a survival kit. But it was gutted. He didn’t open it with a zipper.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,22/9/2020
40,,9/2/2020,"“Quest for a Job” I’m at the restaurant where I worked during university. I’m sitting at a booth across from the pizza oven with a friend. We’re not there for me to look for a job and I’m not working there. We’re just there because he’s hungry. He’s eating a salad. Overtop of the booth, I see one of the people I used to work with. He’s in uniform. I peak up over the booth. We make eye contact and say, “Hey. Wow, I haven’t seen you in so long.” I ask him, “Are you working here again?” He says, “Yes.” I say, “So they’re hiring again?” There’s been some kind of hiring freeze. He says, “Yes.” I wonder if they’ll rehire me because I really need a job. I look to see who the manager is. I’m looking around the floor from my seat and see that it’s George. He had stopped working there just shortly before I did. So I’m also surprised. Eventually he comes back to the pizza oven. We make eye contact and I wave to him and say, “Hey, when did you start working here again?” He says, “Not that long ago.” I say, “Would you take an application from me?” He says, “Here, I’m too busy to talk. Just follow me around for a little while.” So I do. We go back into the prep area and into the walk-in fridge. I’m trying to find out who the owner is and if it’s the same ones who bought it when we all left our jobs. He says, “It is the same ones, but…” and he doesn’t finish the rest of the sentence. I see a couple of other people I have not seen since high school and one who never worked at the restaurant, but he’s sitting there dressed in prep clothes. So, I’m waiting for George to finish the sentence and he goes into the dish pit. I follow him. I grab a few dishes because it’s really busy and I’m starting to help out. We go back into the area where we pick up the food plates. We go over to the bar. While he’s doing something there I put some dirty glasses into the dishwasher. I’m thinking, “Alright, I’m not even dressed for this but I’m doing all this stuff. This feels wrong.” I walk up to the hostess stand and there's a line-up. I’m like, alright, this is a bad idea. I’m not dressed for this. I’m not even wearing proper shoes. This isn’t safe. I walk back towards the table where my friend is still sitting and waiting for me. I explain that they’re hiring, but I’m trying to figure out how to put an application in. I say, “Maybe we should just go home. I’ll drop you off and then I’ll pick up a resumé from my house and come back.” Except it’s really late and I’m afraid that by the time I do that, the restaurant will be closed. So now I’m trying to ask George when the next time he’ll be here so I can bring a resumé back. He says, “Just wait.” I say, “okay,” and I just sit there at the table and wait. Eventually things slow down and he comes back over and says, “Alright, I’m not working again until Thursday.” I’m thinking to myself, “Hmm, he only has two shifts a week.” I say, “Well, I don’t really want to wait that long if they’re hiring because everybody wants a job. I would like to put my application in sooner rather than later.” He says, “Well there is another way of doing this. Follow me.” So we go out the side door through the closed patio and down towards the end of the mall. In reality there’s only one store between them and the end of the mall. But, in my dream, it turns into a dream I had previously where I was with the owner and somebody’s car was broken down (the dream is called the Diode) and we go down to the end of the mall. There’s this complex series of diodes store that we enter. I’m thinking in this dream, “Wow, this is the same store that I had in my dream!” I start to tell this to George: “You know what’s really weird? I had a dream that this store existed a few months ago even though it didn’t, and now it does!” He just looks at me and says, “Hmm, it’s always been here.” We enter the doorway of the electronics store. It’s the same kind of squirrel’s nest of all kinds of tightly packed boxes of switches and diodes. We go upstairs. There are two big doors made of wood at the top of the stairs and a small vestibule in front of it. I realize I don’t have my mask. I turn around and say this to George, but as I reach into my pocket, I feel it - it’s in there. I pull it out and say, “Nevermind, I do have it.” I continue going through the doors. Then I open one door and it’s a poolhall and I can smell cigarette smoke. I close the door quickly and turn around to George and say, “Are you sure? What are we doing here? It’s a poolhall and stinks of cigarettes.” He says, “No this is the right place. You can wait here if you want.” He goes in and goes all the way to the end of the room, gets something and comes out. He says, “Okay, here, this is it. You can fill this out instead of the application.” it’s folded in half lengthwise. But it’s this twenty-five page dossier that wants all kinds of information - banking records, genealogy of your family, and it’s crazy the amount of personal information they want. I look at him and say, “Are you sure?” He says, “Well, that’s the only other way of applying.” I say, “Why can’t you just take my resumé?” He says, “If you can go home and get it before close time, that’s fine.” So we walk back through the stripmall into the side of the building. I see another person who worked there when I did has already put in another application. I’m starting to feel anxious that I’m not going to make this window of opportunity. By the time I fill out this twenty-five page book, it’s all going to be gone. I thank him and leave. I drop my friend off and drive home. It’s pitch dark. I go upstairs, find a resumé, put it in a plastic sleeve and turn around to go back. But it’s already the next day. When I arrive, the restaurant is busy. I’m dressed better this time. I’m wearing the black jeans and the proper black shoes, but not the apron and shirt. I see there’s another manager on duty who I don’t know. I try to catch her eye but she’s busy, so I sit down at the bar and wait patiently. Eventually she comes back. I hand her my resumé and ask if it’s okay. She says, “Hmm, let me see it.” She looks at it and says, “You’re not quite the right person we were looking for.” I let her know I used to work here with all of the other people that have been recently rehired. She says, “Thank you, but no anyway.” I don’t know why but I start to feel really old, really depleted, really horrible. I wonder if I’m ever going to be able to get a job that’s enough to support my family.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,3/10/2020
41,,10/2/2020,"“The Courtroom” I’m not sure when this dream starts if I’m just observing and then become one of the people or if I was one of the people all along. I’m in a courthouse. I can see it from the outside - the big wide stairs, the huge pillars, the giant doors, the big spacious hallways that are made of marble, the floor is really slippery and looks wet but it is not. This is the part where I’m not sure if I’m just observing or if I’m one of the people. In the hallway there are just a couple of people. I’m walking through it trying to find some justice. I can feel this tight ball of outrage mixed with grief in the middle of my chest. I wonder which courtroom I’m supposed to be in. As I'm looking at each door, I’m looking for some sign that this will be where my case will be heard. There starts to be more than just one or two people in the hallway. Now there’s four, then eight, then sixteen; they’re multiplying exponentially. Then they’re starting to talk to each other. The voices sound aggressive. I notice at first that it’s all just men. Then there are so many that there’s no longer any distance between who I am and the rest of the men. They’re only inches away from me and now there’s even more. I’m starting to see facial features. They all look kind of angry. Then someone says, “These aren't regular men. Look, this man’s gay.” As soon as those words are uttered, the crowd turns in upon itself. Someone starts throwing a punch at the other one. Then there’s a punch thrown back. Then just as quickly as the crowd multiplied exponentially, so do the punches. Then some of them start running. They’re running down the hallway. Because the marble floors are so slippery, there’s this sideways running. During the sideways running, the part of the crowd that’s chasing almost catches up. I fear that they’re going to be killed. There are so many chasing them that if they catch them, that’s the end of it. But then they regain their footing and they start to make some space again as they’re running down the next hallway. Then I’m in the crowd, I’m not just watching. I’m looking for a place where we can blend in so the people who are chasing us won’t recognize us. Or is there a door that isn’t just a courtroom but actually leads to someplace we can hide. So this goes on. The hallways are endless. There’s nowhere to blend in because someone keeps recognizing us. Then at one point, there’s enough distance between us and the people chasing us. I open one of the doors. You can hardly see that it’s a door because it’s a white door within a white wall. I open it up and run in. it’s got a push-in button lock. I can feel somebody on the other side of the door. The door handle is in my hand and I’m trying to push the button, but the person is turning the door so that the button keeps popping out. It keeps happening over and over and over again. Then I think this is it and I’m done for. Then I hear this voice on the other side saying, “Please let me in!” I’m like, “Alright it’s not someone trying to chase, but someone trying to hide.” I open the door up and this big round man comes in. I think we’re not going to fit in here because he’s so big. But we do. Now he's in front of me. I think to myself that if someone opens the door, they’re not even going to see me because he’s so big he’s filling up the space. Then I can feel that his body feels soft and doughy, it’s almost like it’s absorbing me. I think, “Well, at least it’s not uncomfortable.” Then I hear the crowd and the noises of the feet pounding and the yelling. They’re getting closer and closer and closer. Then they’re right outside the door. I feel them going a little away and then they’re gone in the distance. Then it’s quiet. I start to let out my breath. My heart’s pounding so hard that I can’t breathe. It starts to subside a bit. I get an inhale again. After some minutes, I’m starting to breathe again. Both of us are scared to open the door. It’s pitch dark in here because there is no justice here. It’s quiet for long enough that the building sounds empty. I think the fight has just gone on outside. It didn’t disappear, it’s somewhere. We open the door, go into the dark hallways. There’s no one in the building. It sounds like no one is in here. We walk down the hallways until we see the door back to the street. The street is dark. This other person just disappears. I’m walking and wondering where to go. Then I see one shop that looks open. It looks like a curio shop. I open the door. It has one of those cowbells on the top and makes the cowbell noise. An elderly woman comes out. She tells me, “I’m over here if you need me.” She disappears into the piles and piles of stuff. I go off into the room to the right. I don’t have any money. At first it just looks like junk, broken, dusty, dirty things. I don’t even really want to sort through them. Then as I look at things more closely I think it’s not just piles of junk, but actually antique furniture. You can see where she started to decorate the furniture to make it look like a store with lamps and tablecloths and little ornaments around those. But as no one was buying anything, she’s collecting and hoarding them. Eventually you couldn’t tell where the arrangement was and where it was just things upon things upon things. But I become interested in the layers because it’s the furniture I’m trying to decipher. In one corner of one room, I’ve sorted my way into it. I’m interested in this desk because it looks like there is a secret compartment in it somewhere. So I’m moving things around, taking all this stuff off it...broken picture frames and I wonder who these people are and setting them somewhere else. I’m moving the lamps. There are too many broken things that I can’t tell what’s what. But once I move a lot of the broken stuff, I can start to see actual things. I move the lamp. There’s a kitchen utensil and it’s old enough that I don’t recognize it. I’m wondering what it was used for. Then I’ve cleared enough of the space on top of the desk that I can open it. It’s one of those roll tops that rolls back into itself. Now there’s stuff inside and it’s just crammed with stuff! So I have to move all these other things. Suddenly there’s a man beside me. I recognize him as this guy who I talked to for a little while then realized he wasn’t a very nice person so I stopped talking to him. Every word he said was so insincere. He says to me, “Look, there are two little pieces of wood at the back of this. If you lift them up, it exposes a secret compartment.” I say, “Oh, how did you know this? There was so much stuff in front of this.” He says, “Oh, I’ve been in here for a really, really long time.” Then he goes back to sitting on the floor. It’s like he’s a prisoner there and he’s trapped somehow. I’m looking to see what was in this compartment. It’s cartons, like the kind of boxes that look like shoe boxes but are made of pretty material...or maybe it’s wallpaper over cardboard. But you see older ladies with them. They wrap things in material and tissue paper so dust moths don’t eat them. There are a whole bunch of these stacked in here. I wonder if this actually belongs to the old lady who has this store. I find her. I go into the other room and find her and say, “One of the desks in the other room has a secret compartment.” She looks at me with some surprise and affection and says, “Oh, you’ve found it!” I say, “Yes.” She says, “Well let me know if you need any help, I’ll be over here.” I think she doesn’t mind that I’m looking through all this stuff and sorting it. I go back into the first room and am thinking that it’s okay to look through all these things! I’m sorting them into different piles. I leave the desk open the way I found it. I go across the room. The man is still there and he has his eyes closed like he’s trapped. It looks like he can’t move away from that spot. In this one corner of the room, I’m sorting through things and I find this beautiful string of lights. There are only five lights on it. It looks like hand-blown glass. The blue is a beautiful color. In fact, you can see the different elements in the blue that would have been exposed when the glassblower was blowing it to make the bulb. You can see bits of orange and terracotta and different shades of this deep carnival royal blue. I’m admiring them and thinking, “Wow, here’s this beautiful thing hidden amidst all of this junk.” I set them carefully aside. Now I find a picture with a round oval frame. It looks like me when I was a little girl. I set that beside the string of blue lights. I wonder what else is in here that maybe once belonged to me when I was young. That’s when I wake up.",Dreamer 3,Freya,BLM,7/10/2020
42,,11/2/2020,"“Missing My Resources” I’m living in an apartment building that is really high up. I’ve never lived in anything like that before. The height is a bit dizzying and I can feel a bit nervous when I come out onto the balcony in terms of not being safe at that height. But I start to get used to it after I do it a few times. I’m living there with my baby, it feels like my first born child. I’m not quite used to how to do things with a baby to organize my time. I’m working online. I only have one room - it’s a kitchen and living room with a little area for a crib and the things the baby needs. I have a table with my laptop on it and other things that I think I’m going to need to teach online. My baby won’t sleep very well. She’s very sensitive to not being held. So she relaxes and closes her eyes after she nurses, but as soon as I set her down, no matter how slowly I do it, she wakes up once she’s in her crib. She doesn’t cry very much. She’s very quiet. She’s just sensitive. I’ve tried wrapping her up so she feels like she’s still bundled. That maybe lasts for another sixty seconds once she gets in her crib, but she still wakes up. I end up carrying her around on my left hip quite a bit. Other than the fact that I’m worried she’s not sleeping enough, this is okay because she is quiet when I’m teaching. I’m teaching online various things. I’m training teachers. I’m also hosting my own classes and making meditations. I’m trying to reduce twenty-minute meditations into a five-minute trailer so that they will interest people into purchasing the twenty-minute and the five-minute trailers are free. As I’m doing this, I also have students live, at least I think they’re live. It kind of feels like a hologram, but they’re still learning from me online but they’re a hologram and I can see them in my apartment. They’re leading their own programs in other places. Someone has some managerial duties for when those programs are released. I can see her there and it’s my old boss. She’s highlighting one of my students who has mined all my material and is just teaching it as her own without crediting me at all. This is upsetting me. I’m trying to make an appointment with my old boss about this, but she keeps dodging my calls and ignoring my emails. I’m getting the sense that she knows this student is mining my material and she’s deliberately highlighting her. My material has been available for a decade longer than my student’s and my old boss has seen it before. I’m trying to contact her to ask to be credited or for mine to be highlighted because mine has never been highlighted and she’s deliberately driving traffic away from me and towards this new student. At the same time as I know this is wrong, I also feel like I’m maybe too old and no one values me anymore because maybe I’m just viewed as old. I walk away from this to get space. I’m feeling really frustrated. My stomach and my throat are in a knot. I still need to finish making me these five-minute trailers. I step out onto the balcony and this is where I feel it’s so high up. It must be fifty stories high and you can barely see the ground. It shakes a little bit when it’s windy. There’s a big hoop on the balcony. It has colored ribbons all around it. It’s like one of those motorcycle stuntmen would rev up and then jump through. It looks like one of those American things that they would jump through. There are red and blue ribbons around it. It’s not only red and blue ribbon, but also some kind of neon reflector tape so that when the sun hits them, they’re really bright. It almost looks like it could be on fire from far away, but it’s not because I’m close enough to see it’s just the chemical structure of the fabric and its reaction to the light. There are two kids on it, they’re like tween girls. They’re playing some kind of game where they’re throwing something through the hoop and then they see what kind of pattern it makes on the ground. I’m looking and wondering what they’re throwing. At first I think they shouldn’t be throwing anything because it’s dangerous and it could hit somebody down below and at this height it could kill them. But then I see that as soon as it hits the ground, it dissolves because it’s actually quite a hot day. They’re throwing what looks like snow cones. As soon as they hit the ground, the cone material melts and it leaves this colored chalk residue on the asphalt. The design they’re making actually looks pretty and deliberate. I think they’re trying to hit certain areas because they’re doing some kind of art attack where when they land, it creates a picture. I still think that they shouldn’t be throwing from that height, but when I look down to the ground I can’t even say anything to them because there’s zero people around. I know my words would simply get lost in the wind. So I go back inside. I just sit there and enjoy some time with my baby. I’m no longer interested in teaching or talking. But the quality time with my baby is very nourishing.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,10/10/2020
43,,12/2/2020,"“Board Games and Cereal” I’m leaving my house with a board game. It’s resting against my hip and I’ve got my left hand around the box to keep it closed. I’m holding it vertical to the ground, not parallel with it. It’s already been opened and played so every so often I have to check to be sure the bottom hasn’t created an opening between the top and the pieces haven’t fallen out. It’s old and the box doesn’t hold its shape very well because it’s cardboard and gets soft after a while. So I’m holding it this way. I walk out of my home and have my daughter and son with me. There’s somebody else but I can’t remember who it is now. We don’t have any front steps and it’s like a ramp. It actually feels like I’ve left a movie theatre. We turn right and go down the sidewalk. There’s a long line of stores. We’re walking slowly because there are so many people we know and we keep stopping to talk. So we only take about two steps and there’s somebody else and we stop to talk again. We eventually go three or four stores down and there’s somebody else I know. They’re trying to control a crowd of window shoppers because some are trying to make a purchase and some are just standing around and are getting in the way. My family and I stop to help. I set the board game down by the cash register. The store owner has brought everything outside in order to avoid people going in the shop and making a big crowd in there. Part of the issue is that no one browsing is wearing a mask and none are social distancing. Then I realize that my family and I don’t have masks on either. I note this and say, “Well, no wonder! Nobody is wearing a mask!” We take ours out of our pockets and put them on our faces. Then I’m trying to get people to form a line and I tell them, “The cash register is over there and you have to line up.” Gradually people realize they should be social distancing so they’re starting to self-organize. I take a turn at the cash register. They’re giving me cash. It’s not debit. I’m questioning this. The store owner comes back having finished organizing what she wanted to organize. She says, “Thank you so much, I can take it from here.” I pick up my board game again. I see Julie, who I used to work with at the restaurant. I realize I’m wearing a hat, glasses and a mask and she’s probably not going to recognize me. She’s talking to somebody else I know who calls me over into the conversation. I say, “Do you know who I am?” She’s looking like she might. I take my hat off first and then I just take one of the loops of the mask from my ear quickly. She says my name and I put the mask and hat back on. She gives me a big hug and says, “I haven’t seen you in so long.” I say, “Yeah, I’ve aged. You look fantastic.” I wait. She tells me about her life. This goes on for a little bit. I wonder if she’s going to tell me about her three boys. She tells me she’s in a new relationship. We say goodbye and she leaves. I notice that a piece from the board game, a house, is moving. It’s escaped from the box and is flying around. I shout this: “Oh no! The house piece is on the move!” My kids are trying to catch it. They crawl underneath a cart that shopkeepers put out on the sidewalk for the day - it has legs and a bin and is made of wire. They’re crawling under these and one of them catches the piece and puts it back in the box. I’m feeling like we’ve been gone from the house too long. We turn around and start to make our way back home. I see somebody else on the sidewalk. There’s a stand up display that a man is hiding behind. He’s peeking to the person standing on the sidewalk. The person on the sidewalk is describing to us a little fearfully that somebody is spying on them. I don’t understand why they’re scared because it’s just somebody looking at them through a natural gap between the displays. I approach the guy that’s been accused of spying and say, “Hey, how are you?” He says he’s good and he says, “Look. I can see the entire street through this little tiny gap.” I say, “Yeah, that’s amazing.” He’s got pajamas over his clothes, but just the legs of pajamas. He’s wearing them like chaps, only they don’t have a belt. I say, “This is interesting, what you have on your legs. May I ask what the purpose of it is?” He tells me it’s just a creative idea he had for dressing and he just likes it that way. It’s not for protection or anything like that. I say, “Yes, it’s very interesting.” Now the other person who was freaking out and accusing him of spying has been deflated and has stopped having a fit about it. The person that was accused, he was walking around and describing how he made these pajama bottom legs. He’s not peeking through the thing anymore. I guess that’s why the other person is okay now. Pajama-bottoms guy walks the opposite way and the other person continues across the street. Then I notice that the pieces of the board game are moving, they’re vibrating a lot. I’m saying to my kids, “We really have to get home now or we’re going to lose control of these things and they’re going to fly out all over the place.” As I’m saying that, the house piece flies out again. It goes way underneath this great big long outdoor bin of a different store. It goes far enough underneath that there are cobwebs. I’m not fantastically excited about chasing it under here but I do because the game is useless without that piece. I saw it go under there but it’s really dark. I feel around with my hand and there’s only one thing that’s not first so I grab it. It doesn’t look like the house piece anymore - it’s flat and not moving. I go back under there again to check around for anything else and there’s not. I put the piece in the box and am feeling like it’s not the piece. I’m already wondering where we’re going to get another one of those pieces. I know that we can’t. We continue on towards the house. There’s a guy I dated for a little while lingering around the outside. He’s trying to engage with my family. I’m like, “Oh, don’t talk to him. I don’t want him anywhere near us.” I don’t speak to him. He’s acting like I did. He’s smiling and being oblivious. He’s walking with my family. I’m getting really annoyed because he’s dense and acting like someone welcomed him in when nobody did. He follows us up the ramp and now he’s in the house. I’m ignoring him. He’s at my back. I set the board game down on the table. He puts his hands on my shoulders and says, “Here, if you put this on, it will take away all the pain from your neck, shoulders and back.” I look down and at first it looks like the thing a catcher wears in a baseball game. It’s made of this dark blue rough cotton stuff, like something a priestess would wear. It’s over my clothes. He’s pulling the drawstrings at the back tightly - they’re laces - the way someone would lace up the back of a corset. It’s very constricting and makes my arms stick out awkwardly by my side. I’m telling him, “Look, I don’t want this. Can you please just get out of the house? You don’t live here. This is not your place.” He lies down on the couch and goes to sleep. I’m poking at him and he won’t move. I don’t know how to deal with this. I’m looking for my daughter to ask her if she can take these laces off and get me out of this thing. I go upstairs and there’s been a whole pile of people up there with a whole bunch of kids. They’ve gotten into everything. They’ve pulled it all out. I get the vacuum out and start vacuuming things up. You know when there’s a whole bunch of stuff in the rug and you can hear it clicking as it goes up the vacuum tube? I’m thinking I’ll have to clean all this up with my hands. I start doing this. I realize there’s more furniture than will fit in the rooms and there’s stuff all over the floor. I’m trying to sort it out and figure out what goes in what room and what we really need. We need something to put towels in and there’s nothing in the bathroom and no cabinet. Where are we going to put all the towels? I go into my room. There’s stuff all over the floor! There’s this three year old kid and I don’t know who she belongs to. She’s dumped everything out onto the carpet. I pick it up and put it in bags. I think I’ve got as much as i can with my hands and start to run the vacuum. When I lift up the bedskirt to vacuum under the bed, the vacuum won’t go any further. I bend down and look. There are bags of oatmeal cereal that have been poured out and dumped. The oatmeal is eight inches thick. It’s all underneath the bed. My daughter comes in and knows I’m upset. She says, “What do you want me to do?” I tell her, “Can you please just keep picking this stuff up off the floor? Look, the vacuum isn’t even getting it all out.” Somebody has taken this black soil from a plant and it’s slightly wet so even when the vacuum goes over, it leaves a black stain everywhere. I’m overwhelmed with all the stuff that isn’t useful and is not in place and the people who aren’t listening to me and are in my house.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,12/11/2020
44,,13/2/2020,"“COVID Dream” I’m in the house, it might even be the house I grew up in - it looks like that, it’s a bungalow. I’m with my dad and we’re planning to go to Niagara Falls and spend the day at the amusement park. There are some other kids going, too, and I think they’re just friends of mine. I’m teenage me. I’m talking with my dad about what rides we’re going to go on. We discuss the fact that it’s cold and we’re going to need to wear extra clothes. So there are some conversations about what we’re going to bring because we don’t want to carry too much but we want the right things for the weather. I’m excited about going. My ex-best friend who I was still friends with when I was a teenager, calls on the phone and I tell her that we’re going. She says she’s going to meet us there because she’ll be in the area. She asks me what time we’ll arrive. I tell her we haven’t finished figuring that out yet and I’ll call her back when my dad lets me know. I hang up the phone and it suddenly dawns on me that the reason the amusement park is still open right now and not crowded is one of the reasons we decided to go. It’s not normally open this time of the year when it’s cold and near Christmas. We also wouldn’t go to an amusement park because it’s so crowded and the lineups are too long. I realize that these criteria are in existence because of COVID. It sinks in that we also should not be going. We can't bring all these people together, we can’t circulate through the park. I feel this moment of rebelliousness where I want to go anyway at the same time I know we can’t and we won’t. I voice this to my dad. He doesn’t say anything. He silently realizes the truth of this, too. I pick up the phone and call my friend back and tell her we won’t be going after all. She asks me what I’m going to do. I tell her I’m going to be home but we realized that the reason the amusement park is open later in the year and there’s hardly anyone there is because of COVID so we can’t go.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,19/12/2020
45,,14/2/2020,"“The Passageway” The property we have is like a winery in the sense that there are wild grape leaves growing everywhere. It’s old. The house is made of stone. There’s a lot of land. We don’t make wine. There is some picking of fruits and a kitchen garden closer to the house, but it’s sustenance farming. We don’t have any animals. The house is vast. We aren’t the first tenants in it. My dad is there, my brother, my sister, and I think my step-mom and other members of the family that are always there. The dream fogs the others out, but I can feel them as bodies and presences. The main characters are my brother and my dad and I until my daughter and her ex-boyfriend arrive. As the dream starts, I’m in the kitchen. Everything is old. I feel like the floor is hard packed earth. The rooms maybe started as one room, which was the kitchen and everybody slept there. Some family added another room and then another room on top of that. So it’s not one big cohesive unit, it’s a whole bunch of different ones. It must be 700 years old. We keep discovering these things we didn’t know were there. I’m using a pup to pump water into the sink to wash dishes. The water is cold, it’s not heated. My dad tells me that we have to go and take stock of what’s in the basement because he has to list the house for sale. My brother and I go down there. The basement is super creepy. There are bugs and things that only move in the dark and webs. No one ever uses it. We have a few things stored down there. There’s no electricity in the whole place. The torch in the torch holder is lit and we each have torches that we hold beside the one in the holder so we each have a light of our own. The only thing we can see is what the torch lights up, so as soon as you move from that spot you can feel the heavy damp of the darkness behind you. I’m sticking pretty close to my brother. There are some old things from when we were babies - the high chair, a trunk, and some other things like that. Then there’s a passageway that leads off. It’s like a crawlspace and there’s no way I’m going in there. I turn around and my brother is gone. I can see his torch light and he’s in there looking around. How can he do that?! He’s in it for about ten minutes. I’m not freaking out, I know he’s okay. Nothing bad has ever happened to us in this place. I trust it, it’s just creepy. I don’t like all the slimy scuttling things and I don’t want them in my hair. I’m on edge. He pops out and I say, “What did you find?” I don’t know what he says. This isn’t the first time he’s been in there and he was checking on what he had in there. He says it’s good. Then we go back up the stairs which are really rickety, and up into the kitchen. There’s a dug out place beside the kitchen; it’s just dirt with big stones. My dad is standing there and he says, “Alright, let’s go take stock of what’s in the barn.” My brother and I still have our torches in our hands but we put them out when we came up the stairs. The torches are all made of wax and now they’re shorter with more wax drippings on the outside because of the time we spent in the basement. We go out the side opening. There aren’t any doors, just openings. The kitchen does have glass on the windows. We go over a meadow into this other place. The stones are piled up. They’ve been chipped away into roughly big square shapes and stacked on top of each other, sawed and stuffed into the cracks to keep the weather out. Grass and bits of organic matter and seeds have grown in the sod. This is what the whole thing is made of, every structure. Now we go into the structure my dad calls the barn. It has a side entrance made of this sod packed stone. We go in there. The whole thing is one big open space which is why my dad called it the barn, except we never had any animals. There had been animals at some other point. We look around. Again, we take our torches. But the torch in this structure has never been lit. My dad has the lit torch. When we get in there, my brother and I put ours on his. Mine won’t light. My brother’s did. I’m calling to them, “Wait, wait, my torch isn't lit!” He comes back. Mine is being really stubborn and takes a little while to light. It does but it's very dim, it’s like it’s wet and it won’t stay going very well. I’m not doing anything except trying to keep up with them. There’s nothing in there. There’s a place we didn’t explore, it’s another passageway off the barn. My dad turns around and says, “Okay that’s good.” I say, “Are you sure? Because there’s a lot of stuff in there. We need to organize this so that when the real estate agent comes, we have all the categories of all the places on this property written down and they’re evaluated separately or we won’t get the value we deserve.” My dad says, “I don’t care. I just want to sell it.” I think he makes some comment about his age and says it doesn’t matter due to his age. I’m arguing with him and say, “Well that’s precisely why you should get out of this property what you deserve. You’re not working anymore. This is what you have to support you through your age.” Now he’s thoughtful. He just doesn’t feel like doing it. My brother and I decide to finish it on our own. We leave the barn with my dad and walk around the outside. I see that there are so many different kinds of fruit growing around - wild cherries, peaches, quinces, pears and apples. I wish I had time to gather these and preserve them. Now we’re back in the kitchen and have a little bit to eat, just some bread and a wheel of cheese. I don’t eat any of it though, I just give it to my dad and brother. Some others who are part of our extended family come to the table that is handmade out of wood. They're standing there. Some of them have fruit in their hands and are eating as they gather around. This is where I identify my daughter and her ex-boyfriend. I say, “We need to go back down into the basement and take more stock of what’s there.” We do this. My brother spends a lot more time in that one passageway. He’s growing something in it. I say, “You’re going to move that though. Whatever it is, you need to move it before the real estate agent comes.” He says, “Yes, I know.” Then he gets thoughtful and I can tell he’s thinking where he’s going to move it. He says, “Maybe I’ll just move it further back because no one is going to go in there.” I think he’s right. I worry about him because no one knows how far it goes. No one has gone far back including him. This makes me feel on edge again. Now we exit the side building. The real estate agent and lawyers will be here shortly. No one has gone through the barn yet. My brother, daughter, her ex-boyfriend and I light our torches and go into the barn. Mine is doing the same thing where it won’t stay lit but the barn is brighter because there are now four torches. I see the passage at one end actually connects to the house, but instead of going underground, it goes above ground and I find it odd that we haven’t noticed this before. The odd thing is that even though there’s nothing there and the barn is a lot dryer and there are no creepy crawlies and webs and spiders and night living things the way the basement had, I always feel a presence at my back like beings you can’t see that are in there. It’s thick with them and I can feel it. We go through the bends of the passage and we end up behind the house. I say, “Instead of entering the house through the side, my dad’s probably in there with legal people, we should go underneath so we’re quiet and don’t interrupt them.” We agree to do this, but the passage takes us into where they are. We’re sneaking around trying to be really quiet and all of a sudden my dad and the lawyers see us and we all start laughing. I say, “We didn’t think you would be here. We were deliberately trying to be quiet so we wouldn't interrupt you.” My dad remarks, “Well you never know where the passages in this house are going to lead.” Everybody thinks this is funny so it takes some of the tension off. However, I can’t shake the feeling that there are other people living in this house who we haven’t found. As I’m saying this, I look up and see the glow of a torch from inside the wall and it’s way up high in the place between the room off the kitchen and the kitchen, it’s in that wall. The wild cherry vines had covered it up but the cherries have gotten really ripe and they’re falling off because they’re so heavy and ripe, so I can see this crack in the stone. I get my dad to lift me up. I’m heavy, an adult size, so I can feel his arms shaking. He can’t hold me up for very long. I got a glimpse of people in there! There’s a dad and a mom. He puts me down. I say, “You need to lift me up again. I saw a man with a hat on.” Someone else lifts me up and this time the arms are steadier. I see a baby strapped onto the mom’s chest and a young boy the age of nine who has covered his face with the same kind of pointy hat his dad has. I notice the mom has one of those hats, too, but the point of hers is tipped over to the side. There’s a whole room we didn’t know about and they live in this room. He puts me down and I say, “We need to find the passageway that leads there to tell them the house is being sold.” I think the buyer is going to tear it all down and I’m worried about this family. We go through the passage again only this time we’re looking at the walls trying to find cracks. I know where this should be directionally. But once we’re in the passageway, it’s hard to keep your sense of direction. We’re in the barn again and I feel the presence. I turn around and this time it startles me and there’s the man with the hat and veil over his face. I say, “You’re the man from the room in the wall.” He says yes and I share with him that it’s going to be sold and I think it’s going to be torn down. He says he has nowhere else to go with his family. My brother says, “Well there is somewhere else.” He indicates the passageway where he has been growing things. The man says, “Oh we’ve come from there and I don’t know if I want to go back there with my wife and kids. I’ve considered it but my wife wants to stay where we are and take our chances.” The dream ends with us having this conversation of where there is to go after there and the sadness that someone would even think about tearing down this magical place that holds so much history. We’ve lived there and survived. The water is pumped from the ground with the handle. We have torches. We don’t need the electricity. We’ve been able to survive on the fruit around the house. I don’t want to leave and neither does the man with his family.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,22/12/2020
46,,15/2/2020,"“Feed Your Eyes” I’m in a hospital waiting room. I have a couple of people with me that feel like friends. It’s my turn to go to the desk and check in. The nurses are continuing to do work in front of us. There are three nurses that are all part of the check-in, so the people who are waiting can go from one to the other or the other to keep the line moving quickly, so it’s not a three part check-in process. The one to my left is moving her line pretty quickly. The one in front of me and the one to my right aren’t doing anything, they’re just writing at their desks. I’m kind of lost in my head, patiently waiting for them to finish up their paperwork, although I am starting to feel uncomfortable on my feet and in and around my hip. I’m thinking there was no point in them calling us up if they weren’t ready to take us. Then I realize that we’ve been standing there for an hour and five minutes. I say, “Excuse me, what are we waiting for? My surgery is supposed to start and I was here at the time I was required.” The nurse in front of me says, “The lights are too bright. We’re waiting for them to dim.” I’m thinking that’s not really reasonable because the lights always look like this. I say, “That’s irrelevant and I need to get to my surgery. Are you going to give me my papers or not?” She huffs and then signs them off and hands them to me. I can overhear her telling one of her colleagues right in front of me that I said the lights weren’t going to get any less bright than they were now and she’s rolling her eyes. I go back to the waiting room and my two companions say, “Wow that was a really long time. I hope you can still make your surgery.” I say, “Yes it was,” and they gather up their things and we go into the area that we’re supposed to go into next. There are a lot of hallways. It’s a very busy ward. I realize I need to use the washroom. There’s someone going into the washroom - it’s someone who has just had surgery and she’s pulling her IV pole along with her. I think, “Oh no! She’s going into the washroom. I’m already late and I really have to go in there first.” Then I see another bathroom just around the next corner. I go in there and go quickly. I can feel the release in the dream in my bladder that built up while I was standing for the hour and five minutes waiting. Now we’re looking for my surgeon. I realize I’ve had this exact same surgery before. Then I realize I don’t know why I’m having it again, but I do hope we find the same surgeon. He’s an older man with very white hair and he was very intelligent and friendly and humorous and he told me stories before and after my surgery. I had the memory that he was still telling me stories when I was under the anesthetic because my subconscious remembers some of the fibers. Then I see him around the next corner and I’m so relieved that I’m going to get somebody competent. At this point, my friends sit down in the waiting area immediately across from the cubicle that has a drape around it where the surgery will be. None of this is sterile at all. They help me get up on the stretcher and then they sit in some chairs. As I’m wondering if the surgeon remembers me he says something to the effect that I know he remembers me. He’s already starting into the recitation of a long epic poem and it calms me. I’m really glad he’s doing this. As he’s doing this, he’s also telling me to count backwards from 10, 9, 8, … and I can feel the effects of the anesthetic starting to numb my body, but part of my mind stays awake. I feel that he’s making an incision from my right hip, up my right side, across my collar bones, then down my left side. He peels back that piece of skin so my organs are bared. I feel him checking that everything is working. My mind’s eye sees the surgical gloves. He’s compressing some organs and manually manipulating them to ensure that they’re functioning properly. There’s a long living sponge that runs below my liver on the right side kind of behind it. It’s supposed to be breathing and moving things down, filtering them, before they go into my intestines. He takes his surgical tweezers and pulls this up and looks at it, making a noise that says, “Oh we can’t have you like this.” He replaces it with a brand new living sponge of exactly the same proportions, then he manually manipulates it with the gloves and watches it work. He’s talking out loud as he does this. He makes the description of what he’s doing poetic - he’s rhyming. It’s like years and years of practice with surgeries has given him this underlying poetic sense of how the internal organs of the body work together. Then he repeats the process once the sponge begins working autonomously. He goes back through the process of manipulating each of the internal organs to make sure that the rhythm they function within is going with this new sponge. He’s kind of waving his arms in the air like he’s conducting some kind of music. He puts the tweezers down, then rolls the skin back from my hip over top, and he smoothes it with his hands. He’s getting all the air bubbles out. He finds little pockets where air is in and he smooths it out until he’s happy with it. Then he begins to stitch it up. Then I can hear him once I’m all stitched. He gives my heart an extra thump and tells me it’s time to wake up. I think I’m awake already. Then I hear him say in a poetic voice, “Although the sleep is nice, it’s time to wake up,” and he’s encouraging me to do this. Then I realize I’m not awake. I start to try and exert my will over my body. My eyes open and he says, “Oh that’s good, I thought you were slipping away there for a minute.” I realize I can speak out loud and ask why I had to come back and have this same surgery again. He makes a poetic remark about the first sponge that was in there not doing what it was supposed to be doing, but I’m not to worry, it’s taken care of and my job is to stay with us and trust. I don’t know if I say this out loud or just think it, but he seems to understand: “I will as long as you’re here to fix me up.” He feels like a grandfather, really warm and vibrant. I trust this man completely and hope that if I ever have to come back, he’s still there doing these surgeries. A nurse opens the drapes of the cubicle, the surgeon departs, and my friends come and help me up off the gurney, one under each of my arms. I realize I’m still wearing this surgical gown. I’m thinking, “Where are we going so i can change into my clothes?” I’m not sure how I get my clothes and don’t remember putting them on, but now I’m wearing them. My friends are no longer holding my arms and I’m just walking. There’s a door in the hall and I’m on a different floor in the hospital. I open up the door. I’m still wearing the bib thing around my neck, but have pants on now. There is a group of employees in this room and they’re sitting behind a desk that you’d sit behind if you were in school. I know they’re supposed to be standing up and exercising. I’ve been in this room before and taught here before. There’s exercise equipment in here. I’m asking a couple of them why they don’t want to get up and start to move their bodies. One lady replies with her hands crossed over her chest as she slumps back, “What’s the point?” She’s just comfortable sitting there and doesn’t feel like getting up. I think that maybe they just need some encouragement. I turn the music up and start moving to the music. I’m not doing systematic exercises, I’m just moving. Then someone else gets up and someone else gets up. There’s about eight people and we’re just dancing. Then I start doing more exercise, like aerobic moves and some people are joining me. I think, “Oh good, that got them going.” Then I walk out the door and they’re all up and moving around. Now my two companions and I are exiting the hospital. I’m walking through the city. It’s moving from daylight to dusk. I notice spongey stuff on the ground just off to the right of the sidewalk. The road is to the left. There’s a combination of goose shit and dog poop on the spongy stuff. I’m thinking, “Oh that’s disgusting.” We walk a little bit further. I realize I don’t have my shoes on and my feet are getting a little bit sore. The man in front of me has a cane. I think to myself, “Oh I could really use one of those right now to take some of the pressure off my feet. Suddenly there’s a cane in my right hand. I lean on it to take some of the pressure off my left foot. But I don’t like what this is doing to my gait, it’s making it lopsided. I wonder if it would be better not to use the cane and just tippytoe through this, or if it’s good for my body to switch it from one side to the other so at least one foot gets a rest. But then we’re finally home and I don’t have to worry. I want to have a bath then find my shoes and socks and get dressed properly and get this hospital bib out from around my neck. I go in my house. My two companions are still with me. It’s a wood house. The wood siding is horizontal and they kind of overlap on each other. I like it. There’s no basement. It’s like a cottage. There’s a big room. We have a grey water system so it collects rain water that we use in the kitchen to wash dishes. I’m hauling it so I can fill up the bathtub. I get distracted from this. I never get to have my bath. Something is going on outside of the kitchen window. I see that the gravel just outside is on top of a raised deck. My two companions are out there with tool belts and toolboxes. They’re in the midst of a renovation. I ask, “What is it that you’re doing?” I realize that one of them is a fairly old man. He says that he has a surprise for me and they’ve been working on it since I’ve been in the hospital and I’m really going to like it. He’s excited as he’s talking and now I’m excited by what they’re doing to the house because I love renovations and I love innovation, invention. I can’t wait to see what it’s going to be like next. There’s a wood ladder that’s more like a permanent set of stairs that you can lift and move around. You know how ladders go vertically up and down? This one is at an angle and is safer because you don’t have to hang on by the edges. I realize we’ve been using it for a while to go from the ground up to the top of the desk. Now there’s another room attached to the deck and the renovations are happening before my eyes. All of a sudden, the cabin is more polished with bigger rooms. It feels like a beautiful house with wood and stone. It’s not opulent though, there’s nothing that isn’t necessary, it’s just newer wood and the rooms are bigger. The green technology that we used for electricity and water is still in place, it’s just a century newer and greener. Then, I realize I’m quite attached to the one older man and want to hear about how he built this. I ask if he can tell me the story and he’s happy to. We sit down in one of the new rooms. I’m looking for the old room and realize it’s been integrated with the new room. The moss that had collected on the roof and boards outside has gone and it’s somehow refurbished. We sit down and he starts talking about how when he was younger he used to build things for his cars, making highways and roadways for them. He says, “It’s just like how I did with your daughter.” I remember playing with her myself and how she used to be fascinated with building structures and moving cars through them. I think, “How marvelous to start something as a child, interacting with things in your environment, and to be able to engineer beautiful big structures that people can actually inhabit and live in and that function so intricately with the elements in the environment.” I’m so happy to be part of this kind of lifestyle. Then this is like an inserted memory from the future. I can see the man and my daughter on a beach. There’s something they made out of sand that goes up one side, over the top, then down. It’s a shape. If you look at it from the side, one side is tall and the other is floor level. But if you look at it from the front, it’s curved. It’s all one structure. It could be the back of a seat if you wanted it to be, but it’s not. They made it out of sand and covered it with a substance with some viscosity to it, it might be a combination of slime and water. The cars slide down through it. My daughter drives a car up one side and lets it go, so it slides down the other side. I’m marveling at the engineering of it. I ask the man, “How did you know to make this?” He takes what looks like a dinky car, but must not be, and he scoops up water from the ocean into it. Now it looks like a scoop. He’s holding it in front of her face and tilts it up slightly. He has his hand resting at the back of her skull. He says, “because always remember to feed your eyes.” He dips the liquid from the ocean into each of her eyes and she blinks and they’re clear and blue. I think, “Yes, that’s exactly what I always want to remember.” The conversation concludes. Then, we go down the stairs. Now I’m using that same cane as the other man and I’m back in the bib again. It’s a funny redo of the dream. There are too many people on the sidewalk so I’m forced into that spongy area that I’m not wanting to walk on. I’ve got all this goose shit and dog shit stuck in my bare feet. Now there’s a sole of a shoe like a sandal on my foot, so it’s squishing all this shit into my foot. I’m trying to find a spot to shake it off my feet. I feel disgusted and want to go back home to wash my feet off and have a bath. The thing with the spongy material on the side was like an insert into the dream, not a memory, but something that happened in the future.",Dreamer 3,Freya,pandemic,4/1/2021
47,,16/2/2020,"“Daycare” I’m in a daycare setting and I’ve been hired to team teach a class with somebody else who’s female. It’s a hive of activity. There are two large classrooms with a doorway between them, but no door. There is a six-foot space where you can walk between the rooms. There are older kids in the other room. There is another doorway where the bottom half opens separately from the top half. The bottom half is closed, but the top half is open, and there are infants in the other room. I can lean over the half door and see this. I’m doing this when the dream begins. There is a man kneeling on the floor. He looks scared. It also looks like he’s looking for something. I ask him what’s going on. He says to me that there’s a large snake in the room and he’s trying to see where it is, but he’s cleared the babies from the room. I quickly look down at the door to see if there’s a crack underneath that he could have crawled through into this room. But, there’s a thick weather stripping piece across the bottom of the door and I really don’t think it’s possible that anything could squeeze underneath it. I ask him if he wants some help. He tells me yes and then leaves through another door that must lead to another class room a little further away. I realize that it does because he indicated that direction with his arm when he said he cleared all the babies out of the room. So he’s taken them to that room. Then he’s gone. The door shuts behind him. I’m looking for the snake but I see there’s still one baby in there and it’s down at the other end of the room, kind of in the shadows. I start knocking on the door and saying, “There’s a baby in here, there’s a baby in here!” He doesn’t come out. I don’t see a snake but I feel afraid. I grab the baby and take it into the room where I am. There’s a high chair and I put it into the high chair and put the safety straps around it. I’m saying “it” because I have no idea of its gender and I don’t even really see its features, it’s just more of a shape of a baby and represents a baby. The class I’m in, there are so many kids and not very much space. I feel like we’re supposed to be trying to organize them, but they’re just pouring in from some door. I feel like they’ve been closed up for some time. I haven’t had enough time to open anything up, so as the kids pour in they’re just kind of running around mindlessly and piling on top of each other. There are just so many of them. I say to my team teacher, “Why don’t we try and get some toys out or some things for them to do?” She’s not really responding to me so I start doing this by myself. I have blocks on one table and as soon as I put them down, three kids come over and start playing. I think this is a good idea. I start taking out some other things in another area. Then I look up and notice there’s a lot of kids in the washroom. My team teaching mate is in the washroom with them trying to deal with that. I feel a bit disgusted in my stomach because there’s food in there as well, and I realize I’ve put my own pack in there. You know when you’re in the grocery store and see them putting bread on shelves and the bread comes out on these big square plastic racks and there’s a whole bunch stacked on top of each other? Well, there’s this stack of plastic bread racks in the washroom and this is where I had put my own lunch, but it wasn’t in the washroom when I came to work that day and now it is. The kids are knocking into it and things are falling off and I have a concern that my apple is going to roll off the bread rack and into the bathroom and this is grossing me out. I walk over there and pick up my backpack and am trying to put my food back in because it’s all spilled out. Then I ask my team teacher what she’s doing right now. She says, “We’re supposed to be taking everybody outside.” I say, “Oh!” At that moment I turn and look towards the room where the snake was supposed to be and there’s another person standing there, an adult, wearing a parka with a scarf wrapped around their head, big thick pants and snow boots and mitts. I can barely see the features, she has glasses on. She says, “We’ve already taken our group outside but I don’t think we’re supposed to be there. I don’t want my kids playing in all that dirt.” I look out the window from our classroom and sure enough, there’s a construction area and a tractor has pushed big piles of dirt and it’s excavation dirt so there are stones and stuff in it. There are two mounds of dirt, clay, smaller stones and bigger stones with a fence around part of it. I guess this is where she’s been told to take her group out to play. I see at least fifteen kids out there in snowsuits. They’ve climbed up the dirt piles and made slides. There is zero playground equipment. They’ve dug out other little holes for imaginary cooperative play. I think I’d rather have my group outside with all this dirt because they’ve organized their own games than this sterile environment with nothing for them to play with. She’s not happy about this because they’re getting muddy. I guess she’s asking my team teacher, “Please tell the supervisor on your way out that we don’t want to be there.” My teammate agrees. The woman goes back out. The supervisor comes through and she takes me with her to go out into this mud playground. She’s listening to the grievance of the one teacher. I’m learning how to supervise. There’s one little boy and he’s climbed up a mound of dirt that he’s made. I see a frozen over bit of water beside me, it’s got a really thin layer of ice on it. I point at that and say to him, “Do you know what that is?” He says, “No.” I say, “Would you like to know?” He says, “Yes.” I carefully crack the edges and pick up a piece of really thin ice that’s almost transparent and about eight inches by six inches with jagged edges. I tell him, “Here, I’ll let you hold this but you have to be really gentle so it doesn’t break.” He says, “Okay, I will!” He picks it up and some of it breaks off, but he does have some between his hands and he’s just fascinated with it. Then as we’re leaving, these other two little boys come up to me and tell me something about the game they’re playing. I bend my knees so I’m lower and say to them, “Have you ever heard of social change?” They shake their heads no. I say, “Alright, can you say social?” and they both say it. I say, “Change,” and they both say it. Now, “Say it together, social change!” and they say it. I say, “Say it a little bit louder!” And they do! They’re jumping around and are happy. I stand up and walk away. The supervisor is looking at me with a bit of a frown on her face. We walk through the door, go back in through the two classrooms stuck together, and I see that all the kids that were in there have gone to a different playground on the other side of the building. On our way out that door, one of the teachers is standing with a two-burner stove on legs, probably a camp stove. She’s pouring this dough onto a griddle. I think she’s making pancakes. I go outside in the playground and there’s a pile of soggy pancakes with sausages in the middle and applesauce poured over. It’s a mess. There are plates stacked on the three bread racks.",Dreamer 3,Freya,election,7/1/2021
48,,17/2/2020,"I’m standing in my childhood home, in the living room. Only the living room is visible. All around me is open space and the impression of “house,” but I can’t see it. To my right where there would be a living room wall is just an open space. I can see other houses lined up sitting on a rainbow, each of them moving up into the air. My father and my brother are in the living room with me and they keep trying to push a button that would shift the foundation of our house off and up onto this rainbow that is slowly ratcheting its way around like the hands of a clock. The houses and my house are moving counterclockwise to the left. I do not like this and every time my dad presses the button, I press it again to stop the house from moving off its foundation. It feels like something else has taken over - that something else has said, this is what we’re supposed to be doing - that these houses are supposed to move up off the ground and into space. My dad is telling me that we can’t live on Gaia anymore and it’s not worth the effort to try to save her. She’s too far gone and that is why the houses need to get on this track on this rainbow that has outer space as the background of the sky.",Dreamer 8,Rose,environment,21/12/2019
49,,18/2/2020,"I find myself at the house of a friend. I’ve never been to this house before and it’s in a neighborhood of Modern McMansion houses - they are square and blocky with large windows. I’m heading up into this friend’s house and we are going through the home and into her backyard which looks like an obstacle course. There’s people training and it looks like she has been working out or coaching. Her husband is there with their baby. I know both of them, but what’s fascinating is I go up to her and she’s always been shorter than me, but in this dream maybe she’s standing on a stair or something. So when I go to hug her, I can tuck my head under her chin and my face is pressed against the top of her chest and I can feel her heartbeat. There’s something in this hug that’s a little bit more than friendly because there’s literal heat between the two of us that I can feel on my face and I can feel it radiating off her chest right above her heart. The history between this friend and I was not healthy in any way, but this seems like a forgive and forget situation with this hug and we are both very happy to see each other. She’s almost like a little kid. She really wants to show me all the things in her home and obstacle course/training area. I can tell she’s been training because my arm brushes against her arm and the muscles in her arm are so hard, they feel like a rock. I can tell she’s so happy to see me. She’s not reaching out to touch me or hold me on purpose, but I can feel that she wants to, which is fascinating because her husband is standing behind her with their baby. We decide to go somewhere. She wants to show me some other things. I’ve already said hello to the husband and the baby is so cute and adorable. So we all head out to the garage to get into her car. Her car is a Jeep which she used to have and sold in real life. This Jeep is even bigger and the husband and baby get in the back and I sit up in the front seat with her. She goes to pull out of the driveway, but she pulls this maneuver where she pulls the Jeep all the way around so I can see the obstacle course in her backyard and there’s a metal railing that’s on the edge of this building that the Jeep has climbed on top of. She pulls all the way forward so the metal railing is the only thing holding the Jeep up - more than half of the Jeep is in the air. I’m a little terrified and looking at her like, what are you doing, we’re all going to die because now you’re driving this Jeep off the end of your building. But the metal railing holds and slingshots the Jeep back and she reverses down off the building, down some stairs and into the driveway, then pulls into the street and off we go. I’m horrified that we almost died, but she’s laughing because it was just a funny joke. Then I have a scene change and it’s nighttime. I’m walking into another house. There’s lights on and a party going on. I know some of the people in the party, but I don’t know all of them. I am like, what am I doing here? I don’t like parties, I don’t drink, I don’t smoke, I don’t do any of the things people do at parties. I don’t know why I’m there. The overall feeling is one of major resistance and I have bile rising in my throat and disgust. I’m watching what others are doing and keep thinking, “This is not me. I don’t do parties like this.” It reminds me of high school or college, and who knew what was going on in all of those things. I just felt gross and wanted out. The scene changed again. Now I’m in a grocery coop and being trained to work there. But it’s also like a retreat center and there’s grounds with wild animals, or maybe they aren’t wild. At some point I see somebody saying goodbye to 4 lions and the lions walk up to them and snuggle with them like you would hug your dog goodbye. That’s happening on these grounds with green grass and trees and flowers. There’s other animals - I can’t tell what they are, but I can tell they’re there, I can feel their presence. At one point it seems like a retreat center because all of these people are gathered and it’s women - mothers and children mostly - and some men. We are on a deck that looks like a ship because there’s a beach nearby - I can hear and smell the salt water and moisture in the air. We’re all gathered because there’s a huge pile of lost and found clothes and we’re trying to give them away. It’s the people that have come to the party. So they’re trying to identify who owns what clothes. There’s bathing suits and little kid clothing and all kinds of stuff. I’m running around looking at these clothes and wanting to hand them back to the mothers. But there’s somebody auctioning them off. It’s strange because while they’re auctioning these off, there’s an underlying layer of guilt and shame for losing their clothes in the first place and for the size of the clothing - they aren’t all tiny extra small bathing suits or leggings. I’m pissed off and go gather up all the clothes because I know whose clothes belong to who. I walk around returning the clothes without the spectacle because it’s so shaming and degrading to the mothers who just misplaced an article of clothing. That completes and I go back into the building part of this retreat center/coop grocery store. I’m learning how to stock shelves and the clean up duties - what is necessary before the retreat can close for the night or season. It feels like closing for the season. Some people are painting and I’m noticing they’re doing a horrible job. They keep missing places or getting black paint on places they shouldn’t. There’s watering of plants and trimming of dead parts of the plants. People keep leaving the plant pots places, so I’m gathering these extra pots and I don’t know where the plants themselves have gone, but I know we want to save these plant plots for new shoots. So I’m gathering them up. There seems to be an awful lot of steps to close up this place, but it’s time to go and it’s mostly clean. The water fountains are cleaned. The wood has been polished. The not quite right paint is mostly dry and just a few parts are missing black paint and some parts have paint passed where it’s supposed to be. But for the most part, it’s tidy, everything has been picked up, there’s no clothing left anywhere. This is when I turn and see the person turn around and say goodbye to the lions. There are four lions, all males. I’m watching them hug these lions goodbye and wondering when they’re going to be eaten, but they don’t. Then the dream ends.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,22/2/2020
50,,19/2/2020,"My brother (the one born right after me) and I are hanging onto a brown balloon - it’s shaped like a physioball and is big enough for both of us to be laying on it with our stomachs on it and our arms around it. This ball/balloon is floating up so high we can see the Earth and all the continents and oceans. But the ball is slowly losing air and we’re getting lower and lower. It’s getting smaller and we keep readjusting our grip - grabbing more of the ball to pull ourselves back up because it’s getting smaller and our position is not as stable on it. While the ball is getting lower, we’re going over some parts of the land where I can see castle ruins in some places and they look like medieval castles and some look like those gorgeous buildings in Russia. They’re different styles of castles, but it’s all ruins and no humans have been there in a long time. Then we’re floating over the ocean and the ball is getting closer to the ocean. I look down and begin to panic because I can see the ocean is vast and incredibly deep. Both my brother and I do not want to land in that ocean with this balloon. So I manage to adjust the balloon so the part where you blow the air in is near my mouth. I start to blow air into it all while hanging on and floating through the sky. I get the balloon a little bit bigger and before when we were up at space-height we were able to direct which way the balloon was going, but once we got further down, we couldn’t direct it until I blew more air into it. It gives us enough time to have control over its direction long enough to land someplace where there’s water, more land and ruins. These ruins look like metal buildings that are all rusted. We land on a metal ledge and there are huge elephants with really long tusks and they’re essentially killer elephants who are not so happy to see two humans in their territory. It’s very clearly their territory. So now my brother and I have left the balloon and we’re trying to run away. There’s parts we have to swim across because these ruins are in water. Some swimming has to happen and we’re not particularly quick swimmers, but we’ve somehow met up with a different group of elephants that want to help us. Each of us grabs onto the back of one and they swim us across these expanses to the next section of metal of these buildings. Now we’re at a section where we have to climb up. I don’t know how the elephants climb up, but some of them do. My brother and I are climbing and it’s like free-solo style climb up this metal wall, hooking our hands into rivets or other handholds on beams. We’re climbing up and trying to go as quickly as possible because there’s a herd of super angry elephants that are red at this point and chasing us. So we get up top of this building. Now it’s very jungly. The water is way down below, but there is jungle plant life all around us. We’re stuck at the top and now there are multiple groups of elephants and other things trying to get to us to kill us. My brother and I are with some other people, but I’m not sure who they are or when we met up with them or how they got there. We’re at the top of this building and all of a sudden there’s all these monkeys and apes climbing up. They’re positioning themselves on the edge directly below where we are. They’re there to defend us and make sure nothing gets to us. I reach down to say thank you to one of the apes that looks like a baboon. They reach up and they keep saying, “You’re so loved!” Essentially, they are all there to sacrifice themselves so that we are safe. I am aware that I’m lucid and crying in real life as I hear these apes or monkeys saying that and they are actually going to keep us safe from these angry elephants.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,27/2/2020
51,,20/2/2020,"I am with a bunch of my sisters/friends from this timeline and time period and we are at one of their houses. It’s a huge expansive place. The house is big, the front yard is big. There’s a table set up at the front because we are celebrating somebody’s birthday, I’m not sure whose. Maybe we’re celebrating everybody’s birthday. We’re all there with our kids and the kids are running around. There’s lights strung from the trees. The table in the front is a really long picnic table and it's covered with food because we’re all eating at the table. It feels incredibly expansive and joyful. There’s lots of coming and going in and out of the house and lots of conversations happening at the table. I’m kind of wandering around. At one point I notice my daughter is running around with a friend's daughter and my son is somewhere playing in the dirt. I am having a conversation with a good friend. That seems to be the entire point of the dream. At one point I carry more food out to the table and sing happy birthday to somebody - or some sort of congratulation is happening. Then the dreams shifts a little and I’m talking with a friend of mine (in real time and in this timeline) - someone I’ve met over Instagram - but we are face-to-face in this part of the dream and that feels nice because we seem to totally get each other. I'm chatting with her and she all of a sudden says, “Oh, there’s this man I want you to meet.” She says his name and it starts with C - I want to say it’s Cyril or something but I don’t quite catch it. I can feel that a part of me is questioning. The scene around me has changed, too. I’m no longer at this big wide expansive home. I’m at her home and it’s so open. We are standing outside in a driveway and her house is behind her in the backyard and there is a garage to our right. We’re near the garage but we are outside and it is dusk now. A porchlight is on. This guy pulls up on a motorcycle and she’s like, “This is the person I want you to meet.” He’s got this leather jacket and his hair is longish and curly or wavy and dark. Yes, he’s definitely good looking, but all my alarm bells are going off because he’s riding a motorcycle and wears a leather jacket - how cliche. And he’s got tattoos. She says, “Oh, he’s a plant medicine maker, so he knows how to make medicine from plants.” That peaks my interest because you don’t meet a lot of men who know how to do that. But I’m still feeling like I’m being put on the spot and I don't appreciate matchmaking. It feels awkward because I know he’s been invited there to meet with me. I don’t like those kind of situations. I would much rather there be an organic conversation where you’ve met or something. In this part of the dream I am feeling so awkward with meeting this guy. But I’m still feeling tender feelings for my friend - I still love her very much and I don't care that she’s set me up with this dude. I think it’s kind of funny. Anyway, I’m not into it. In the next part of the dream, I’m taking him and a couple friends on a tour. The dream switches scenes again. Now I’ve left my friend who has done the introductions, but this guy is with me. He’s off the motorcycle at this point and there are other guys with him. They’re his friends, I think, but they’re all strangers to me. I’m giving them a tour of what I think is my old high school, but it’s in the snow and my old high school was in Hawaii. So this version of my high school is somewhere in the snow - there’s lots of ice. We get in a car and I’m driving them up and around the drive that usually takes us to the school. We drive past the chapel part I grew up going to, past the admissions building. I’m taking them onto campus because these guys are all going to run a race. So it’s a bunch of hotshot runners or super athletic guys. Again I’m asking myself, “Why am I with all these guys? Why am I showing them around?” So we actually end up driving past the beginning of the race and we have to go park way down below in a parking lot. To get to the beginning of the race is a ton of stairs covered in snow and ice. Now because it took a while to drive around, school has let out, so there’s a bunch of students out and it’s really really crowded. So these men I’m leading around are getting a little bit frustrated because it’s taking extra long to get to the race. They’re worried they’re going to miss it - it’s a running, cross country race. It’s cold and they’re in their running shorts - not my problem. I lead them up to the beginning of the race through all these stairs. We’re winding our ways through the crowds, being careful not to slip on the ice. The headmaster of the school comes to greet us. What’s interesting is that the school now has a ton of people of color going to it, including black people, but these guys I’m bringing with me are all white. This is interesting because I’m noticing as we’re walking through the crowd, the guys I’m leading are being rude. They’re totally trying to use their white male dominance to move themselves through this crowd. They’re pissing a lot of people off. So the headmaster meets me, and the headmaster in this dream is actually the head of the Waldorf School my kids currently go to now. Her name is Cecilia and she’s a woman of color. She meets me and helps me lead these men to the start of the race. But she is giving them a lecture on white male privilege, dominance, the patriarchy and their atrocious behavior. There’s a part of me rubbing my hands in glee, getting to listen to Cecilia school these men who have been incredibly arrogant. We get to the start of the race, which is interesting, because it’s actually through a bunch of buildings and they have to race through a bunch of doorways before they can get outside. It’s literally doorways and Cecilia has had me go open up some of the doors so they know which doors to go through. I mark them somehow, so there’s literally a little note that says, “Run through this door,” so they can find their way to the outside, because there is an outside part of this race, but it literally starts in a building and they have to run through these doorways. Now Cecilia has been joined by a male teacher of color who is continuing the lesson and lecture for these white men who are all still in their running gear - short shorts, tennis shoes, a sweater because it’s cold. They are finishing up this lecture and the white men are part of this other group. The other group has people of color in it. They’re not in the front to start this race. I really don't know how it’s going to go because everyone has to run through these doors and these doors are not lined up one after the other. You run through a door, then you have to hang a right to go through another door. It’s quite maze-like until you get out. But they’re all set up, ready to go, and the lecturing is done. Sure enough, somebody shoots off one of those little start guns and they start running through. The dream ends there.",Dreamer 8,Rose,environment,28/2/2020
52,,21/2/2020,"Multiple parts to this dream, but only a few that really stand out. I am living in an apartment and across the street is where my ex lives with our kids. He’s selling the house they live in. I’m so sad because they're not going to be closeby anymore and he’s going to be having the kids full time. So I won’t get to see them because they’re not there. But what is the most sad is when I walk over to his house - he invited me over to see if I wanted anything from it because he was selling it furnished with all the things in it, including some of the kids’ stuff and some of his stuff and things I had made for the kids. He was leaving it all there, leaving it up to the realtor to sell the house as furnished. At the time I go over, he’s there with our son and our son is going through all his things, grabbing what he wants and leaving the rest. I’m feeling so heartbroken about it - just the fact that they’re moving and the kids are going to be far away and that there’s all these things that are unwanted, uncared for and untended, including things that I have made for the kids. Oddly enough, my daughter is nowhere to be found in this, she’s already moved on. My son is also not incredibly sad. He’s very pragmatic about what he wants to take with him and go. I’m looking around and the house is full and my ex is just leaving all of it where it is. They both leave and I’m really sad when they leave when I say goodbye to my son because I feel like I’m not going to see him again. That feels heartbreaking. Then I’m standing there in what feels like the wreckage of a life. I’m standing there in the house and the realtor comes with a client and is showing the house. I’m there but it’s almost like they can’t really see me. I think it’s odd that this person is contemplating moving into this place with so much stuff still in it. I leave because it feels so heavy to be in there and I go back across the street to my apartment which is just me. I’m sitting on the balcony. There’s a gorgeous view in front of me and I can see the ocean and the curve of a shoreline. It looks like there’s mountains that come down to the edge. It reminds me of Hawaii. There’s a blue towel that I’ve hung on the clothesline out on the lanai. It’s one of the old blue towels that my ex and I inherited when we got married - they were his college towels. It has a hole and a rip in it because those are the towels I use for cleaning up gross things or wiping down dogs. It’s fluttering in the wind in front of me and blocking part of my view. It’s just one of the rattiest towels with a hole in it and it’s all I can focus on. Then other parts of the dream happen, but this one other scene has stuck with me: I’m in a group of people. I’m not sure who all is in it, but there are classmates from high school again. I think we’re inside, but I can’t even tell - that doesn’t seem to matter. There is a fire pit somewhere in the center. It seems to be some sort of gathering or meeting where we’re electing a leader or someone who is going to present a plan to help us out of some sort of pickle that we’re in. We’ve done this before. We’ve been here before. The last time we were all in this circle, there was no consensus. We weren’t able to choose anyone. This time around, the person who is coming to the forefront is somebody who I’ve always had a fondness for and always known was quite brilliant. He and I lock eyes across the circle. He stands up and gives a speech to everyone, which is quite short and something along the lines of: “Just elect me.” I’m realizing that’s not going to convince anyone because he hasn’t told anyone why we should or what his skills are or what he’s good at. So from across the circle, I yell out: “Tell us why you’re qualified!” He kind of goes “oh” and you see it register on his face that he didn't think about saying that before. So then he starts to list off the reasons why. This feels very tribal - the whole thing feels like this was way before current day politics or how we come together in board rooms or how we do meetings. It’s much more a gathering of the tribe, which is why the fireplace. It just feels much more primal than the way we do it now. He lists off all his attributes of why, and of course some of them include: “because I’m strong.” That seems to sway the crowd and everyone agrees on him being the leader. Then the dreams go on, but I do not remember.",Dreamer 8,Rose,election,5/3/2020
53,,22/2/2020,"Just a few snippets of dream: one is an outside battle of sorts happening. There’s some forces that are trying to wipe me and my companions out. I’m not even totally clear who my companions are. I just know I’m responsible as I’m part of the team trying to keep humanity in general safe - it’s a general feeling of protecting, but I’m not sure who I’m protecting. It’s not anyone in particular, it’s just a group of people, some of whom are my friends and some I don’t know. It is totally a preparation for some sort of standoff or battle because me and the other friends or colleagues are planning and prepping and come up with a battle plan. It totally reminds me of a movie. I don’t even know what's coming for us, I’m not sure, other than that I know that me and some of the others have superpowers and we’re making our plans around the powers we have. One of the people on my side is projecting out this gel that freezes anything that’s coming towards us. So whatever it is that’s coming to attack us starts to attack - they have a green aura around them. This person puts out their gel and it does freeze some of the enemy but doesn’t last. As the battle continues, it’s a full on attack and we have to fall back because we end up not being able to hold our position. It was very dramatic and I can’t even remember if it was missiles being launched at us or what was coming, but it was a life or death situation. Then some other parts of the dream happen. The only thing I can remember of this second part is another group of people and a man who I don’t know and his friend who I also don’t know. The first group I’m watching go into an old fashioned horse and carriage. They load into it from a barn type area and they’re getting a tour of a ranch. I’m not sure what the business is, but they load into this carriage and they go down on the tour. Part of the tour takes them to the entrance to the ranch where there is a big sign that announces the name of it. But this entrance place also has an herb garden where they’re allowed to gather some herbs as souvenirs. I am down there with them. There’s chives or green onions that we’re growing but they’ve dried somehow. So you can pick them up and take the dried chives with you. There’s also lemongrass and a bunch of herbs and people are able to gather them. I’m gathering them and working the ranch - that’s my role. I’m part of the tour but I also have work to do on this ranch to keep it going. The man is the owner of the ranch and there are a ton of other people who work on the ranch with separate roles. There’s a bookkeeper and all these other people that I don’t know who have roles and do a lot of planning for the tours or parties that come through, they do this man’s finances and just sort of run things for him. I’m mostly a little worker bee out on the land. So this group of people comes and goes and I'm getting the feeling this is a regular stop on a tour. Then the scene shifts a little bit from daytime to evening. The man is in the carriage thing and he asks me to go for a ride with him. His friend is driving the carriage. I get in and we head down the driveway like we’re going to leave the ranch. There's a place where the road turns and on the right hand side there’s a huge mud pit. You can see old tire tracks in it, but I’m really concerned because if the carriage falls into this mud pit, it is never coming out. I’m watching the friend struggle a little bit. He’s really close to the edge and I’m concerned. He has all my attention even though this other man who I’m sitting in the carriage with doesn’t seem to be concerned at all. He’s keeping a conversation going with me and I have one mind on the conversation with him and one mind on the fact that this carriage could get really stuck and fall off into the gigantic mud pit. I finally say something to this man and he says not to worry. At this point, the carriage turns itself around so I can see the entrance of the ranch with this big sign. It dawns on me that the whole reason for the driver to have been going so close to the mud pit was a distraction technique so that I wouldn’t turn behind me and see what they were doing to the sign on the ranch. When the driver finally does turn the carriage around, I see the sign on the ranch and it’s a marriage proposal from this man in the carriage. I’m so confused because this man is essentially my boss all the time and we don’t have any relationship that I know of and all the people that work for him have been changing out this sign and preparing this whole thing. I’m a little bit speechless and really confused and thinking that there’s another person this man would rather be with. I remember sort of sitting in the carriage going: “Well let’s try some things out and see how we work together.”",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,9/3/2020
54,,23/2/2020,"There are three distinct parts to this dream. The first part I remember is a gathering of a lot of women - at least 25 of us. It’s a retreat and it’s towards the end of the retreat. It’s my friend, Carmen, who is hosting. She’s been doing a lot of the teaching. I’ve been in the mix, too. I’m not a participant, but I’m there. I can’t tell if I’m helping out with the retreat or not. She’s giving the ending teaching or wrap up of the retreat to all these women. They’re mostly older women - a little like elders in training - that seems to be the theme of the retreat. She’s giving them a speech, more or less, that’s along the lines of: “Okay, now you women have these tools. Go forth and do your eldering.” I am witnessing this and someone has asked me to go hang out the laundry, which is something I used to do all the time in Hawaii - I used to hang out all of the laundry for our house. We didn’t have a dryer. Then even when I moved to the mainland, in the summertime I would hang out all of the laundry. When I did it as a child, I resented it because it was just another chore I had to do and it was not my clothes, it was everyone else’s clothes - by everyone else, I mean the 9 other people in my family, so there were a lot of clothes. I am out hanging this laundry now for the retreat and I’m feeling frustration and resentment build because I can hear all the women who have been on this retreat and they’re all complaining. I’m thinking, “Did you not learn anything from what we just did?” They’re all holding hands with each other. They’re all in it together, complaining together, and also completely ignoring the fact that I’m hanging out their laundry. Or maybe not ignoring, but more that’s what I should be doing because I’m not an elder. I am so frustrated because all I can see is how seemingly selfish they are and that they don’t have anything to complain about. They're complaining about parts of the retreat and parts of their lives. I get so sick and fed up that I leave their clothes where they are and I walk away from the clothesline and I walk away from the whole retreat. I am thinking that I need to leave them all to their own devices because they don’t get it. That’s the thought going through my head. Then the dream shifts and I’m in conversation with my ex-husband about our daughter. It’s my time with them - we’re still sharing custody and visiting time. My son is there and he’s closeby - he’s with me. But my daughter is not there and I’m asking my ex where she is. He tells me, “Oh she’s at her friend Gus or Gum’s house.” I say, “Who is that? I don’t know who that is.” He tells me that he is a teammate of hers. She’s apparently playing soccer and this is her teammate. But she’s 12 and this boy is a little bit older - that’s the impression I get. I’m starting to get pissed off and scared because I don’t know this kid’s parents and they live in another county. There’s a little map flashing before my eyes and the place they live is highlighted and flashing and it’s far away from where we are - at least a day away by car. I’m starting to panic because I don’t know this kid, I don’t know his parents, I haven’t talked with my daughter in a long time and I don’t know what she’s doing and I don’t trust that she’s safe. I start yelling at my ex, telling her he can’t just let her go to places that he doesn’t know the parents or the situation just because she wants to hang out with a boy, essentially. He doesn’t get it. His face turns stone cold. I’m trying to keep my voice even and level. But the more he grey rocks what I say, the louder and frustrated I get until I’m just yelling at him. I’m so disgusted with him. His dad is the one driving my daughter down and back and he’s there. I’m just as mad and frustrated at him. It feels very much like they’re stonewalling me and taking my daughter. But they're putting her at risk is what I feel. I'm panicked and so upset but getting no answers from them. I’m asking them where this boy lives because I want to go pick her up, but they won’t tell me. So the dreams shifts again and I retain the panic. In the next shift of the dream, I’m hanging with some friends - some are from high school, some are from this time - other instructors I’ve met at the pole studio. We’re all outside. It’s a bright, beautiful sunny day. We’re walking down a paved path - it’s available for a lot of people to walk on. It’s me and another girl and another guy. Other couples are around me as well. We’re all walking and there’s space between the other couples and me and this girl and this guy. I’m noticing that they’re starting to hit it off. I can’t tell if I’m jealous or frustrated. I’m having an emotional reaction, but not sure. Some of it is that panic has carried over from the last part of the dream. Again I’m thinking, “You guys don’t really know each other. It’s probably not a good idea to hook up right now.” We all stop walking. We end up at some sort of grassy area. The couples have split off - they have their own blankets. This guy and this girl - there’s a sense that I know who they are, but I’m not seeing who they actually are - they split off, too. Everyone gets under a blanket. I’m watching and can tell that these two are hooking up. I’m like, “You don’t know each other!” I’m looking at this through the lens of us being in quarantine and I’m thinking it’s probably not a good idea to hook up with someone you’ve just met while we’re in this quarantine. I’m just really concerned again. Then somebody passes out bathing suits to all of the women. I’m watching as all of the women and all these couples put these bathing suits on. They look different on every single woman. It’s very interesting to see how it’s the same cut of bathing suit bikini, but looks so different on every single woman. I have one, too, and am trying to put it on. But I’m putting it on over my clothes and I don’t understand why I’m doing that, other than the thought going through my head is that I want the added layer of protection. Everybody else seems a little bit carefree and somewhat nonchalant about the situation we find ourselves in. It’s like they’ve hooked up with their person and it’s them and their person and they’re okay. But I’m by myself. I’m watching all these couples and the ones that have been together I’m like, “yeah okay, they’re good,” but the ones that haven't been together, I’m totally horrified and that sense of not just panic, but a little bit that I’m in the wrong frequency goes through all the dreams - that I’m just not in the right timeline. That sense, I woke up with and still feel.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,22/3/2020
55,,24/2/2020,"I’m working with a friend and we’re having a meeting. She also has clients and we’re in her house. She’s showing them how she does some of her artwork - some of her painting. I’ve been doing emails for her and she's giving me some fabric that’s super cute. I quickly and nonchalantly sew up a top and skirt with the fabric. The skirt and top are cute and match the artwork she’s creating and is showing clients and friends right now. I’m working on emails and greeting cards - getting those uploaded to a computer. She’s in another room doing this meeting. She calls me in and we continue consulting with the client. She asks me where I got the outfit I’m wearing. I say, “This is the fabric you gave me. I turned it into a skirt and top.” It feels good between us - she’s my friend and my boss. We’re having a good time and I’m really enjoying working with her. Then the scene evolves a little bit. We’re in the same house area, but now it’s my house. We’ve completed our work and she leaves. I’m realizing there’s really weird stuff happening outside. I get it in my head that I want to call my ex-father-in-law who owns the mortgage on my house (this is actually true in real life as well). Because weird things are happening, I want to call and say, “Hey, there’s a freeze on all mortgages and rent, so I’m not going to get it to you this month.” I’m on the phone talking to him and I've gone outside. It’s a little bit dark and ominous. It is nighttime. A wind has picked up. I’m talking with him on the phone. There is no hello or anything; I haven’t even gotten out the words to ask him about the freeze. He says, “I haven’t received your rent check this month. And I’ve heard that there’s a drone outside your house and I’m a little bit confused.” He’s starting to fade out like the connection is bad and I can’t hear him anymore. But the gist of what he’s saying is that there’s a drone - somebody has been flying a drone outside my house and filming me. It’s at the windows and it films me. I feel super violated - like my privacy has been violated. He’s really shaming about it even though I didn’t know there was a drone there. But his connection finally dies and I don’t hear him anymore. I go to call him back and try to get a hold of him so I can tell him I’m not paying rent. I hear him say something about there’s going to be an inspection. Then the connection is totally dead. I feel concerned because now I’m worried about this drone. I head back to the house. The house looks like a Victorain era dollhouse - it’s got one of those roundish rooms that reminds me of a tower and a lot of frill on the trim. I’m walking towards the house, but first I’m in the parking lot. There’s a parking lot and what looks like low income housing - they’re all one-story, the roof is flat, they’ve got a carport, and they’re all connected like apartments or a motel, actually. I see a friend of mine and she’s got a couple of kids. Then there’s a sheriff and he’s inspecting the place, but giving her an extra hard time. She has the front door open and her kids are running around. He’s telling her: “Your house looks dirty from outside.” He’s making her show him her car which also is dirty. He’s totally just giving her a hard time. I’m watching to make sure that he’s not just harassing her. It feels like he’s doing his job, but going out of his way to be a total asshole. Then he sees me and he heads towards my place, and he’s like: “Your house stinks. It smells, especially right here on the back porch area.” There’s actually another guy waiting for me on my porch. I recognize him as my lover - I think - but he doesn’t look like my type at all. He’s got blond hair and blue eyes. He’s kind of tall and it looks like he’s just come from a football game because he’s got his football gear and he’s really sweaty, stinky and smelly. But I guess this is my person because I’m really happy to see him. He’s standing on this porch where the law enforcement person is telling me it smells really bad. I look and I see there’s a window seat that juts out from the house over the porch a little bit. Underneath the window seat is one brown wool sock and one bottle of forgotten soda or something. But the foundation of this porch is all stone and is rotted - there’s moss and it’s black and the stone is crumbling. My lover is standing up there and he comes down and he greets me. He shushes the sheriff and we start to go into the house. But my brother shows up. He starts to dig out the stone that’s rotted. I’m like: “Don’t do it!” I know that the smell coming from it and whatever is under it is supposed to stay under, like it’s an old ancient curse or something - kind of like they bury vampires. I’m like: “Don’t go in there.” But my brother starts digging it up. Sure enough, there’s a body wrapped in chains. It’s folded in on itself. As soon as my brother gets the rock off, it unfolds itself and it’s a king. I’m horrified: “Now you’ve done it. You’ve just let the bad guy out.” Then I hear some other rock crumbling. I’m up in the tower place now because it has all the windows. I turn and from my vantage point, I see that the queen has been let out, too. She’s also been in chains. They both have gunk on them because they're so old. I’m like, “Fuck, this is not good.” I’m trying to grab me and my lover - now we have to leave the house. Now we have to get down these stairs and past these things and out past the house. There’s a level of horror and also comedy because the queen is hideously ugly and she’s just bitching. She’s clearly very bad tempered and it’s a little bit cliche in that way. We’re coming down the stairs trying to avoid them and we do make it outside. I don’t know what happens to my lover - he disappears. I run into this 11 or 12 year old boy. He’s kind of playful and naughty - very much trickster energy. I can hear a voice that’s sort of narrating what’s happening with this queen and king coming out and this boy who is kind of teasing. He’s running off away from me and the queen and king are trying to follow him. I’m thinking that they’re the bad guys trying to catch this boy, but this voice that I’m hearing suddenly shows up. It’s a man with a troubadour hat with a feather and he’s dressed in stockings - like Shakespeare, old style. He’s got one of those frilly collars around his neck. It turns out he’s the one that either the king and queen are chasing, or he’s chasing the boy. I’m not sure. It’s a little convoluted. I just know it's time to get the hell out of there because whatever is happening is not my business. The house is a lost cause. I have no idea where my lover went. My brother is off - I don’t know where he went; he let these things out and now he’s gone. I’ve been heading towards a crowd, following this boy and watching things unfold and I just let myself get lost in the crowd.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,23/3/2020
56,,25/2/2020,"I’m at a party, it’s pretty swanky, like a cocktail party, and all my high school classmates are there. I’m feeling a little bit intimidated because they all seem to have these really well paying jobs and lots of prestige and I work at a grocery store. They haven’t said anything, but I’m feeling like, “Uh, I don’t really want to tell them where I work. That doesn’t feel super good.” Fear of judgment and all that. I’m making plans to hang out with one of my friends - we’re going to go somewhere, I think shopping at a clothing store. But I tell them, “Okay, I’ll be back.” I leave the party and the scene totally changes. I’m in a house that I’ve never seen before, but it's a house that’s owned by my kumu hula from when I was a hula dancer in Hawaii. The kumu hula was incredibly emotionally abusive and not kind to me. She was probably doing her best. I’m in her house. That was my hanai family, too, when I was in the islands, so I spent a lot of time at their house - way more time at their house than my house in my teenage years. So, I’m at her house, which I don’t recognize, it looks different. Her husband, Uncle Jay, is there - he was also my kumu and hanai family. They’re talking to me about planning how they’re going to remodel parts of their house and how it’s going to cost them money, but they finally have money for it, or someone is giving them money or they’re going to earn it. I’m there with kumu and her son who is also in the dream at his younger age (when I knew them, he was 4-8, so he’s one of those ages). They’re showing me how they’re going to do it. They’re really, really friendly - it’s now how I remember it when I left the halau. They are just trying to show me there’s different ways. I’m making plans for the next day and kumu actually says, “Well, come back, be here with me and help me work in the store.” So I guess she owns a clothing store and I have an option of helping her. We finish talking and I go to my room in this house. Another friend calls and wants to make some plans with me for the next day. It’s like everything is stacking up on this next day. My kumu is inviting me and she’s like, “We need you to be here - this is part of our plans for remodeling the house.” Then my friend is like, “Well I need you to come and do this thing with me.” Then there’s a third opportunity to do something on this next day and I’m feeling torn because I don’t know who and where I want to be, but I also know that I want to do my own thing. So, I end up at this clothing store. I remember going through the racks and there’s all these crappy t-shirts like you’d find at Walmart or Grocery Outlet. They’re on one of those round racks and I’m going through them and not impressed. Then one of my friends from the party appears and is telling me: “Oh, we’re doing all these things, come do this with me.” A second friend from the party comes and she’s like, “Guess what? Now I have a job at the grocery store.” She’s super proud of it and is telling other people and seems to almost be holding it over me that she has the job at the grocery store. But I had never told them that that’s where I worked. It’s just a repeat of this weird competitive energy from outside and also within myself, so torn about where to put my attention and focus and none of it feeling right and true to myself.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,28/3/2020
57,,26/2/2020,"I’m on this field trip with a bunch of children - an entire school’s worth. They’re all 5th grade and younger, but not below 2nd grade - there aren’t really young children there. We’re at this state park. It’s gorgeous. There’s an open field that’s two football fields long and at least one football field wide. It’s on one side of the road that’s the entrance to the park. Trees line the road and the field. On the other side of the field there’s all forest and it’s pretty thick and dense forest - it’s dark and you can’t see really far into it. Then on the other side of the road it looks like a school with buildings that look like classrooms but also could be places or cabins where you can pay a fee and stay. I see a playground and a cafeteria or place you can eat where they sell the shitty food you’d find in parks - ice cream cones and corn dogs. There’s another building on the left hand side of the road with the big open field or meadow. The building is on the end of the field. The road goes down and stops at this huge wide river. On this side there are rocks or sands that go down into the river like a beach. On the other side are tall, tall cliffs that drop off into the river and it is deep on this side but shallow on my side. The river flows from left to right. This is a familiar river to me. So there’s tons of kids hanging around. I’m there. At first I thought I was a chaperone, but I’m not. There’s tons of other parents who are chaperoning all the kids. I’m providing supplies. I have bags and bags full of clothes for the kids to wear - the same dress for all the girls to wear or the same pair of jeans for everybody to wear. It’s really bizarre. I have a hundred pairs of them in all different sizes, so everybody has a pair. I’m also in charge of setting up and spreading out the food, but also telling people where to sleep. So I’m basically providing all of the basics for people and organizing it. It feels very much like I’m providing the most efficient way for everybody to get what they need. But I'm also participating in this sleepover campout as one of hte kids, too. So I’m not taking a parent role, even though my kids are there because while I’m providing all these things, I’m actually in my later twenties. There are some other teenagers or early twenties kids. So there’s a little bit of an age gap, but not so much. I’m definitely not in a parental role, per se. With the younger ones, I’m making sure they’re not going in the river and getting drowned. But me and the other twenty year olds are flirting, which is the craziest thing. I’m making sure everyone is sleeping and finding sleeping areas. I head down to the river and there is a path kind of like a boardwalk - it’s got wooden slats. I take this path and it’s taking me towards this other building. I’m not entirely sure what’s there. There are some laundry machines. One young man is following me. He’s blond and his hair is curly, shoulder-length. He’s very good looking in a very angelic way - the way they paint those angel portraits from the Renaissance era. He’s got his arms around me. I’m the older one, definitely showing him how everything works, but he’s very like: “I want to be with you.” I’m finding it strange because there is at least an 8 year age difference between us. I take him with me to where there is all this laundry piled up from clothes that all of these 100+ kids wore yesterday. I’m looking at it and realizing I’d rather be spending time with this person and I don’t want to be doing all the laundry for everybody and making sure they know where their assigned sleeping places are and making sure that they all eat. So I have just left food out for them to come get as they want. I have left the laundry, like “Yo parents, wash your own laundry if you want.” I leave them to their own devices to sleep wherever they want - parents you’re in charge and here are all the sleeping bags. They do, but they all end up being cold and hungry because no one is actually taking care of them now. But I still feel like I’m not the chaperone or person in charge - I don’t even know how I ended up with all of the stuff for everyone. I am way more interested in cultivating a relationship with this person, except that it’s very short-lived. We leave the building that has all of the laundry and other stuff in it. We go back to the group in this big field surrounded by trees. Everybody is milling around. There are a lot of cars parked in part of the field. I’m watching some parents drive off with their kids but not watching out for other kids. It’s giving me a heart attack because I’m afraid someone’s going to get run over. I leave this guy. He had his arm around me, we were walking side by side and at one point we were holding hands and kissing. But I left him to make sure some of the kids didn’t get run over. I turn around and he’s got a blanket over him - one of the blankets I provided. But now he’s with this younger girl who is younger than him, so I guess she’s teenage-aged if he’s in his early twenties. I’m like, “Uh, what the fuck?!” at how quick his attentions turned. So now I go back down towards the river one more time. I’m watching everybody. They’re awake and playing. Some kids are wearing the clothes I provided, but some kids are wearing other clothes because now they’ve got it figured out. Some are learning how to swim and there’s an instructor teaching them how to swim in the river. As I’m walking down the boardwalk again and there’s sand off to one side, I see that this dad has soccer balls in a huge jar. He’s showing the kids that there are three different kinds of soccer balls and they each have different amounts of energy and power. So he’s keeping them in the jar. One of them is a regular soccer ball - if you drop it, it bounces a little bit but doesn’t go very far. The next one he shows us, he says, “Yeah, look how much power’s in this.” He drops it in the jar and the jar comes back up at least five feet off the ground and you see this soccer ball make an explosion within the jar because it has so much energy and power in it. Then he says, “That’s not even the strongest one.” He grabs this third soccer ball and he drops it. When it lands, it’s in a jar again - somehow these jars are not breaking - and it bounces above my head. Every time the balls bounce, they flashlight. So it’s three different levels of power within each of these soccer balls. The last two have so much power that they have to be contained within jars. I’m kind of fascinated by it. He’s giving these kids a lesson. I’m paying attention, but then continue to walk by. Then I hear another kid (these kids are more like 12, 13, 14) shouting and he’s looking in the water. There’s a gigantic jellyfish that’s yellow with red long jellyfish arms - I don’t know what they’re called. It’s floating in the river and I’m like, “Holy shit! There’s jellyfish in this river? We should not be teaching the kids how to swim in here.” It comes up to the shore and then the fucking thing is panicking me becuase it starts to crawl on the land! There’s the boy who saw it and a couple other girls, and I’m like, “Y’all need to get away from this thing because it is crawling up the land and it’s going to sting you.” I stand on a chair, thinking it won’t be able to crawl up the chair. It doesn’t crawl up the chair, but it latches itself onto the bottom of the seat. It’s an outdoor chair that’s metal, so the seat is wire - like the crosshatch - and the back is a wrought-iron metal back. I’m like, “Holy shit! This thing is dangerous because it can crawl on land and it can crawl up a chair!” It has latched itself to the bottom of the seat. It’s giving birth and laying two jellyfish babies. I’m not even sure they’re jellyfish because they’re on land! I’m totally freaked out and trying to make sure that whatever kids that are nearby are out of the way of this jellyfish. I had been standing on that chair and then I step on another chair, then a few steps back. Then I go and tell all the parents to be careful of this fucking crazy jellyfish and don’t let the kids in the water because it came out of the water. This thing is horrifying me because it can walk on land and it’s in the water, so it’s that much more dangerous. I’m worried about the kids.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,30/3/2020
58,,27/2/2020,"I am with my friend, Aila, who is Native American and also keeps incorporating parts of my kumu hula teacher from when I was a teenager. As Aila, she is very reverent and has a lot of knowledge. She is bringing a lot of spiritual knowledge and reverence to my dream. As my kumu hula, I feel uneasy around her because she was very emotionally abusive towards me and oppressive of who I was. So I’m going back and forth through a lot of feelings in this dream. Aila is trying to organize a ritual and gathering. She’s trying to gather the people to do ritual. She’s also trying to gather the people in protest. The gathering is happening on a train. We are all getting on this train. The train has a destination, but I’m not sure where. There are men and women. We are gathering in a town and we’re trying to gather because the powers that be - those in charge of the town - are actively trying to suppress us, suppress our rights. I just have the sense of them being the bad guy - and it’s men. We’re all on this train and there are police officers who are trying to interfere and interrupt. Aila’s kids are with her. Mine are not, but I know where they are. Along with the other townspeople, there are also a bunch of younger men who are teenagers or early twenties. We’re on the train and gathering for the ritual, but it’s taking a really long time to start. As I watch, the younger men get off the train. They are not there to support. Their excuse is that they have to go to their practices for their organized sports, whatever that is. I’m watching and I see Aila’s partner Austin who is this very tall cowboy with the boots, the hat, the buckle. He gets off the train to go rather these younger men who are basically deserting. They are deserting their wives, girlfriends, mothers and even fathers - the older grey beards - who are on the train. Aila is still preparing for ritual for all of us to take part in. But Austin leaves to go get these younger men. I leave because I realize my kids are not with me and I want to go get my kids - it’s really important that they be part of this. Both Austin and I are headed in the same direction, but are not going for the same reasons. We exchange a few words. We head towards a lagoon in the ocean. I’m facing the lagoon and to my right is a break wall - it’s just a stone break wall with cement poured over the top so you can walk to the end of it. On the far side of the break wall is the wild, wild ocean - it’s totally untamed. The waves are huge and it's windy. Then on the other side of this break wall is this lagoon with a glassy surface and you can see down towards the bottom and you can see the animal life growing in it. The lagoon has another boundary. It’s not quite a break wall because it doesn’t break the surface of the ocean, but is maybe a reef or manmade. It creates a curve. Actually the whole lagoon is a circle because the break wall on one side is curved and this wall underneath the water is also curved. My kids are there. I can see my daughter and son are playing in the lagoon - the safe side. I’m watching as Austin walks down the break wall on the wild side. He dives into that wild ocean and I watch him swim out to a rock that makes it relatively shallow. He stands up on the rock. He’s having this moment with the sun shining down and illuminating him, and the water is glistening off his skin. Austin in waking life is a very tall, thin person, but in the dream he has all these muscles. He comes back to gather the young man. In this lagoon, my daughter is playing with one of my hula sisters from when I was younger. She was younger than me at the time. They’re playing together and you can see that my daughter is white, white, white and my hula sister is mostly Filipino - so you can see the super blond hair and the dark hair. My son is also playing in the water. I’m making sure they’re both safe and not going too deep. I have this feeling of being very protective of both of them in terms of whether they can swim or not. It’s okay that they’re playing. I don’t have any concerns about who they’re playing with. I think that because I’m watching an interaction happen between my daughter and my old hula sister. They’re definitely working something out. I’m not concerned about that part at all. I’m just concerned that both children don’t drown. I’m also watching Austin trying to gather up some of these men. Some of the young men who left the train are here at this lagoon. They're not at the practice like they said they would be. They’re actually jumping off the lower submerged wall. One section of it has a structure built on top of it that looks like a carnival booth and they’re jumping off the front of it into this lagoon. They’re having a grand old time, but definitely not doing what they said they needed to do, which was go to practice, and they’re definitely not supporting everybody on the train. I’m watching this happen and by this time I’ve swam out to the center of the lagoon and am standing on one of those rocks that lifts you up out of the ocean. I’m watching these young boys and have feelings of disgust because of their choices. Then I turn to look back at the entrance of the lagoon and I see Aila come down. She looks so weary and grief stricken and tired and exhausted and sad. I’m concerned and don’t know what’s going on. She says, “The train was raided by these police officers.” I’m seeing police officers with those helmets with the shield and the bat. She says it was raided and they kicked everybody off the train and they did not let us practice and we never got to the ritual. I had seen her start to light a candle and she had her feather and was smudging. She says, “We didn’t get to it. We weren’t allowed to gather. The police broke us up.” I can feel the frustration and oppressive nature of this event happening and also her exhaustion and grief. I feel feelings of guilt because I wasn’t there to protest against it. She is saying how they tried to arrest her and they arrested so many people. I have these conflicting emotions because I am completely furious and boiling the water around me, and also guilt because I wasn’t there - I had gone to go find my children because the ritual was taking so long and I was concerned about them. I notice that she wants her children and her children are with her. She’s hugging them. Her attention is just on Austin and her children. And even though we are the best of friends, she’s sort of shut me out. I can feel it. It feels hurtful and also at the same time, I am completely understanding because it’s the thing that she’s always working towards - some sense of equality. To be able to bring a community together in ritual like that and to have it shut down by the man is just exhausting. The dream ends there with me feeling pretty shitty.",Dreamer 8,Rose,BLM,9/4/2020
59,,28/2/2020,"There’s one part where I’m nursing a baby. I think it’s mine. My breasts are engorged as if I haven’t nursed in a while and the milk is coming out so fast, it’s almost choking the baby. Then I’m with my parents. I’m outside on a street. There’s a curb and a bunch of stand up paddle boards stacked. There’s a bunch of water coming down the street. It’s flooding again. These stand up paddle boards are stacked outside of a store and they’re starting to float off. These boards are a product that once you use them for their initial use, they turn into something else, then turn into something else again. I think it’s quite clever that the people who own this store have managed to figure out how to make items with multiple purposes. So the stand up board changes into a tank for a toilet, which is super efficient and only needs very little water and one flush, then also turns into an indoor house plant or a decoration. I am getting the sense that the products this store is putting out are amazing because each product is 3 different products within one. I’m standing in this street that’s flooded, trying to restack the boards, because I think it’s important for people to get on board with a shop and people who can figure out how to be so efficient and not waste materials and provide the basics of what we need because a stand up paddle board seems like a good idea when the streets are flooding. Then, the dream shifts. There’s a lawn. I’m standing on the side. There are a bunch of people mingling on the lawn - mostly white people. But there’s a Japanese family - mother, father, son. They’re a little bit away from the rest of the crowd and it looks and feels like it's a bit awkward and they aren’t being welcomed into the crowd. But they’re making do because they’re talking with each other. I see the father pick up a pinecone to toss at the son, for him to hit with a bat or catch, like baseball. The dad is in a suit. Everyone on this lawn is very well dressed. All of a sudden, the scene changes. I’m at a Japanese baseball game - in Japan, Japanese players, Japanese crowd. They’re so athletic. I’m watching the pitcher pitch and the batter sprint. I’m taking in their very athletic movements and noticing how in American culture we’re very snobbish and don’t think that others are as athletic as we are. But clearly these Japanese players have major skill and are even better than our American players. I’m also noticing how attractive each one of them are. I’m like, “Wow! I should be dating a Japanese baseball player!” Then the scene shifts. There’s a Japanese woman with jet black hair, down to her butt, straight, shiny, gorgeous. She’s in a skirt suit and I notice she’s wearing a wedding ring. She has a clipboard and cellphone. She’s clearly very busy, runs a lot of things, is very important. She’s walking down a sidewalk under trees. It looks like she’s walking outside the baseball stadium towards the owner’s booth. I watch as she sits down in there. The dreams shifts again to something else and I’m not actually in most of it; I’m just observing again.",Dreamer 8,Rose,environment,18/4/2020
60,,29/2/2020,"The felt sense of this dream is sticking with me - a panic from the coronavirus. I’m in my home, but it doesn’t look like the one I grew up in. It’s warm out, like Spring. The ocean is around in the background - I can hear it. My parents are there along with a dad and two sons who I grew up with. This dad was my dad’s business partner when my dad opened a restaurant. He was a chef and a referee for soccer. I’ve organized a talk because they’re trying to take away our rights. It’s a big community. What’s most striking is this place we’re having the talk is this open lawn - a communal area with grass, trees and shrubs - pink camellia blossoms - and white picket fences everywhere and white folding chairs where we are all sitting. I can feel how everyone needs to sit down and listen to this. I have an agenda and really wanting people to listen to this talk that’s happening, which I feel like I was a part of putting it together. My mom and dad are there and I have this feeling that I have the talk for them to listen to because I want them to grasp a point. I’m upset about something. The talk starts. Coronavirus is happening in the dream. We’re afraid we’re all going to be sick, but we’re wearing our masks, but sitting way too close to each other. People are complaining about not having their freedoms and liberties. The talk is going according to an agenda and people are wanting to say, “enough with this social distancing, isolating and taking away our rights.” But then Bob and his two sons come along with a bunch of other men and boys. They’ve all had the coronavirus and their mothers and wives have died. They’re up in front of us and trying to tell us what it’s like to have this and how devastating it is. Bob is saying that even though he and Sarah were divorced, Sarah came back from a trip to the UK with her partner and didn’t know she was sick. She was cleaning silverware at her job at the hotel before she came down with it and she and her partner died. Of course everyone who was at the bank where he had been and using the silverware got sick and some died and some didn’t. Both the boys got sick. They look pretty pale and wan. I hear one say it was the first thing he ever had to recover from. He’s not looking like his full healthy self, neither is the other son, and neither is Bob. They give their talk to all these people. There are a bunch of mothers in the crowd - moms with their babies and young children. My brothers show up at one point. They’re sitting next to me. I have my kids with me. There is so much community in this dream - people I know - and it’s shocking to hear Bob and his sons talk about it and see their sorrow at their loss. The dream goes from this outdoor area to a home. Part of the reason I was calling the meeting is I was protesting that my home was being taken away. Now my ex- father-in-law is in the dream and he’s trying to kick me and the kids out of the house. I’m like, “We don’t have anywhere to go and the coronavirus is out there.” Then Bob and his sons who’ve all had it (we’re not sure if they’re contagious or not) need a place to stay. My parents offer them our place to stay. My brothers and I are trying to set up a place for them in the attic. The confusing part is all of the different people that come in - sometimes it’s my parents, sometimes my siblings, sometimes my ex, sometimes my kids, sometimes my friends including one of my friend’s from high school, Nani who I haven’t spoken to since we were Juniors - she’s one of the friends sitting near me. All of these people I know are coming and going, and sometimes I’m talking to my dad and sometimes I’m talking to my ex-father-in-law. Emotions are swirling a lot and I don’t know if I’m mad at everyone or happy to see them or scared for them. I know the feeling of upset I have for Bob and his two boys is big. I’m so worried about their experience and I know the fear is real. But I can’t tell how I feel about all the other people that keep showing up. They keep coming and going and playing these roles. The last part I remember is being in this attic of a home and listening to Bob and his sons talking about what it’s like to have the virus. I’m making a place for them to sleep - laying out bedrolls and sleeping bags. But I’m aware that I’m not wearing a mask and should probably be wearing a mask. The whole time I should have been wearing a mask especially when we had gathered for the community meeting. I’m very concerned about it. Bob speaks eloquently about what it’s like to lose your loved one because you didn’t believe that the coronavirus was real. That’s what I woke up with.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,19/4/2020
61,,1/3/2020,"Two parts to this dream: In the first one, I am with a man, but I’m not entirely sure who it is - it could be my ex, it could be another friend of mine, Josh. He’s very protective. I’m lying down on my back. I can’t tell where I am. There’s a mother ferret and six of her babies lying on my stomach. The babies are little and I’m protecting them. The mother is very content and happy to lie there with me and have me guard them. So I’m lying still. The babies are slowly growing - I’m watching them grow and am being very protective. The man with me is also being protective. I’m not exactly sure where I am - it seems to be outside on the grass. All of these members from my old CrossFit gym and other CrossFit gyms show up. They really want a workout, but it’s the time of coronavirus, people can’t really gather and the gyms are all closed. But all of these people are close to each other - definitely not 6 feet away. They’re gathered around me and I’m definitely still vulnerable because I’m laying on the ground with all of these ferret babies on my tummy. These CrossFit people want a workout and music. I have my iPhone with a playlist that I can play. But I’m telling them: “My playlists are for pole classes. It’s not your normal CrossFit playlist.” They don’t care. They’re adamant that they get a workout. So, it’s either the man I’m with or me telling them to run an obstacle course. It’s kind of like a free for all on this obstacle course. Somebody is trying to win and there aren’t any rules, so people holding other people back and stuff like that happening. But I say, “Okay, the winners get some of these ferrets.” During this whole time, the ferrets are getting bigger and bigger and bigger. Two of them get to be adult size. I put a collar and leash on them and give them away. Along with this man, there are a couple of other people around me - I can’t tell if it’s my kids or somebody else’s kids. So I give those two ferrets to these children. They go off with them. So there are four baby ferrets left and all of these CrossFitters trying to win. I’m disgusted with their narrowmindedness about needing to get the workout in at all costs, no matter what else is going on in the world or that I have these baby ferrets that I need to take care of and they’re super precious and fragile and we need to be gentle. All these CrossFitters feel single-minded and not so bright. They just need to do this run. Some are bitching about the music and playlist even though I warned them it wasn’t going to be what they thought. I’m super annoyed with them. They run off to do their run. My attention is back on these baby ferrets - the four that are left are not full size yet but they are growing, and the mom is still with me. As each of the babies gets bigger, I give them a collar with a little leash so their owner or whoever has them takes good care of them. There’s this process I’m going through where I’m a little bit sad to have nurtured these little ferrets and now they’re leaving me. I end up giving them away, but I can’t remember if I do give them to some CrossFitters or if other people show up and I finally feel good enough that they’re going to good homes. That section of the dream ends. The next part of the dream is now I’m in the observer role. There’s a man and his son - I don’t know who they are. He’s caretaking his son in a very beautiful way - he’s very attentive. They’re in a neighborhood and a block party is happening. While the man is taking good care of his son, some of the neighbors start to get really nasty and accuse him of being gay and a molester and get really homophobic. As the observer, I’m not very neutral. I’m absolutely irate at the ignorance of the people who are accusing this man of horrible things and who clearly loves his son and it’s not their fucking business what his sexual orientation is. They start to ostracize him. All of the neighbors pull their children away from him, as if he’s going to harm them somehow. One of them says, “We need to take your son.” The man stays pretty even keeled in his response; however, I’m fucking pissed. There’s a popup tent and he goes under this tent. He starts to tell a story about horses, but it’s clearly a metaphor for his life - about how he came out and he’s actually very gentle and would never harm anyone. The adults are way back in the crowd and they’re basically not listening - they’re all talking amongst themselves. But all the children come to sit around his feet and listen while he tells the story. The man finishes his story and as I listen in, some of the children start saying the most profound shit - spiritual truths coming out of the mouths of babes. The parents are fucking oblivous - still being nasty and homophobic in the background. This man gives a horse figurine to each of the children and they take the horse figurine and go back to their parents. The man’s son stays with him as the children disperse. I am wondering if the wisdom of the children will be heard because the parents seem so stupid, for lack of a better word, and that’s totally my judgment coming through, because I was not a neutral observer. I had no patience for the parents and really wanted them gone and out of the dream.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,28/4/2020
62,,2/3/2020,"I’m with my kids. They’re going on a trip. They’re going on a huge boat. The boat is in the harbor and there are icebergs all around. So, clearly we are someplace very far north. My daughter is getting ready. She’s doing that teenager thing where she doesn’t really want me around to help or anything. She’s got it, like, “I’ve got it Mom, I don’t need your help.” My son is clearly very excited. I’ve helped him pack everything. I’m trying to get a lunch packed for him. I have this container and I’ve made beautiful fajitas or something delicious looking and smelling. I’ve made it for him. I’m trying to put the lid on and for whatever reason, the container has bowed somehow. Everything is running into itself. Now the lid is a little bit tight and a little bit smaller. I’m trying so hard to get this lid on the lunch so he can have food while he’s on this trip. He’s in line. There’s this long line of kids of all ages that are going to get on the boat. There are teachers all around as chaperones and other parents. There are sections, too - a section of the line with kids who paid for lunch and they have a lunch waiting for them, and a section of kids who don’t have that. My son is in the latter section because I have his lunch for him. I’m really struggling to get the lid on this thing. I have a sense of panic that I’m not going to have this ready for him by the time it’s time for him to get on the ship. So I run down to the place where they have the lunch pre-prepared for the kids. Some of the teachers are standing right there and I ask them to help me. I add some food from the prepaid lunches because I know my son eats a ton. The principal of the school says, “Hey, that’s $30 for that.” I say, “No it’s not. I'm adding just a few things. He already has his lunch and I’m not paying $30 for that. Just help me get the lid on this thing.” We finally get the lid on it and I go back and hand it to him. I’m worried because I think it’s just a mess now. His lunch is just a mess of food all glopped together and he’s not going to eat it. But he takes it and he says, “Thank you, Mama.” Then the kids all get on the ship. I watch them as the parent. Then I’m in the observer role because it’s like I’m on the ship, but the kids can’t see me. I’m just watching everybody move around. The trip is all about climate change. There is a purpose to this trip on the ship. I don’t know if it’s because they are going someplace meaningful or if while they’re on the ship, they’re learning. They all have to take classes while on it. I think that there’s some sort of thing that they’re doing to help the environment. I’m not sure what. I do see my friend Ana. She is an instructor for them of some sort - I think it’s the physical activity instructor. I think she teaches them yoga. I observe her come up and talk to an older group of girls who is doing that older girl clique thing. She talks with them and gives them some instruction. The thing that strikes me is that everyone is in really really warm clothes because glaciers and the ship is moving through huge icebergs, and she’s in a fur coat and clogs with fur on them. In the dream, I’m wondering why she is wearing these heeled shoes on a ship? That seems not safe. She gives instructions to the young ladies and she has a clipboard. It’s clear she has duties and things to attend to, so she moves on. I’m watching as all of these things are happening on this ship. It’s a pretty well oiled machine - all the kids are getting the lessons they’re supposed to be getting, they’re getting fed, or there’s an instructor - somebody there with them. The work that they’re doing is really, really important for themselves and for the planet. I don’t know where this ship is going - we’re in open sea with icebergs but no land in sight. This ship is a self-contained world where really important things are happening that will affect things outside of it, but for the moment, everything happening on the ship is really important, somehow.",Dreamer 8,Rose,environment,9/5/2020
63,,3/3/2020,"There are a couple parts to this dream. The dreams go into deeper dreams where I’m a little bit less lucid and then I move towards more lucid, or I’m more awake. The deeper part of this dream is me on an airplane. It’s showing up in flashes. There’s one part where I’m in an airport. I’m looking at the arrival and departure boards to find my flight and the gate. There are people bustling all around me. There are gross fluorescent lights everywhere. Shops, too. It’s busy - no social distance is happening, so I don’t know if it is this time or another because everyone is close. No masks. It’s normal. Then I go from looking at this board to being in the airplane and in my seat. I’m on the end of the middle row where there are three seats in a row. There’s an aisle and then two more seats and a window. There are people all around me that I’m sorting of chatting with. I’m with a group of others, I think. I have this sense of keeping track of the other people. I’m sitting in my chair. You know how on long flights your shit ends up everywhere - that’s happened. I can’t find my sweater. We’ve landed and it’s time to disembark but I can’t find my sweater. I’ve taken up two seats in this airplane and it seems to be fine because there was no one near me. There is a stewardess or another passenger who has taken offense that I took my sweater off and maybe my shirt off, too, and was just making myself at home. But now we’ve landed and I’m trying to get my stuff so I can get off and go. It takes me a minute because I can’t find all my things. I disembark. I have a sense that the place is very, very different from Earth. It doesn’t feel like an Earth place and the flight attendant that was talking to me didn’t look quite human. So, there’s this sense that I’m in another realm. I have a sense of agitation, too, because that group I was with is off doing their thing. It took me time to find all my stuff and I feel a little left behind and I don’t want to be because I don’t know where I am. I get on a tram. It’s more like a train that will take us to our destination. I feel out of place. I don’t know where I am - this place is new, this tram is new, I don’t know where I’m going. Even though I’m part of this group, I don’t know all the people around me. It's just a little uncomfortable and I feel disoriented. Then I come out of that part of the dream into another part where my ex’s presence is around. He’s not in the dream with me, but he’s been around. We’ve definitely been divorced. I’m agitated because he’s pulled more super controlling shit. I’m just wanting so badly to get away from this person, to get out from under his thumb, to not have to interact with him in any way. In the dream he does have the kids. It’s just me in the dream, but there’s a sense of him being around with the kids. I feel like I’m under surveillance as if he has cameras on me. I don’t even know where I am. I think it’s a house, but I’m not sure. I leave the house and go out into town. There’s a building that is a retail shop. Things are sold out of it, but I’m not entirely sure what. I need to go there because there’s a desk that I’m trying to fix. What’s interesting is my dad shows up. The front of the retail shop is all these floor to ceiling windows. A lot of them have been broken - someone was throwing bottles or rocks. There’s glass everywhere in the entry area. I need to go in. I know this shop is owned by my ex and his father. There’s something about a desk that I need to get or repair. Or I need to get something from that shop. My dad is there and trying to sweep up all the broken glass. My dad is actually part owner of the shop, or maybe he owns the land that the shop is on. I’m watching him and he’s super ineffective with his broom, so I just grab a broom and start sweeping. Between the two of us we get the glass picked up. The glass is in tiny, tiny pieces - not quite sand, but pebble size. It didn't break in big chunks - it broke like safety glass into little round pieces without sharp edges. The entryway is paved in cobblestone, so the glass is getting stuck in the grooves. We sweep up all the glass and I don’t know what we do with it. I go inside the retail shop and walk in through one of the broken windows rather than the door. There’s the desk that I need. I go to pick it up and move it and it just falls apart. I look underneath and the structure of it is crumbling. It’s like that really thin pressed board that cheap furniture is made out of and if it gets wet, it swells and disintegrates. It’s made of that stuff. I’m underneath the desk and trying to fix it. I ask my dad for help. He hands me a roll of duct tape. I try to duct tape it back together. I’m working on it and wondering why I’m trying to fix this desk. It’s my ex’s, I don’t want it, why am I fixing his shit? This desk is not going to provide what I need and is not the thing that I actually need. I come up from under the desk and there are other sturdy pieces of furniture made of real wood. I can see them and I’m comparing them to this desk. I have this sense of, “Oh god, please make sure that my ex or his dad do not show up at this shop while I’m here.” I have their permission, but don’t want to interact with them and their super controlling, contemptuous attitudes of disgust. I know I don’t want to be there when they arrive, so I’m trying to hurry.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,13/5/2020
64,,4/3/2020,"I’m in a house. It’s very cluttered. One of my brothers is with me. All of a sudden there’s a bunch of tiny little black bugs swarming. They all hatched at once and they’re the size of a freckle. They are everywhere and jumping on me and him. We’re both like, eww get them off. I’m trying to brush them off with a little broom, then trying to suck them up with a vacuum. I'm kind of giving it up as a bad job and thinking I just need to get out of the house. We hear this little squeaking. There’s a rat in a bunch of white paper towels in the shape of a body cast. It’s essentially the same shape as the rat. You can hear the rat inside. Its legs are not in the cast. It’s running towards me and my brother. My brother scoops it up. I get mad and say, “No, no. Give me that rat. That’s our friend. That’s who’s going to help us get out of this mess of tiny little black bugs. We need that rat. That rat loves us and we love it.” As I’m saying this, the cast on the rat is getting looser and looser. There’s more space between the rat and the cast. While I’m looking at this rat, part of me is like, “eww, it’s a rat,” and another part of me is like, “well, if I squint, maybe it will look more like a cat. That will be more acceptable.” It’s clear that this rat very much loves us. I can feel myself trying to love it back, but it’s a rat and it’s so hard. Then the scene changes. Now I’m in a home. The part of the home I’m in is like a tower. It has windows on three or four sides. It’s a square room with a round table in the center. It’s not really big - maybe 10 or 12 feet across in all directions. One side of the room does open up into the rest of the house and is bigger. There is sunshine streaming in through the windows, blue sky and white puffy clouds. It’s gorgeous. I’m having a conversation with my ex father in law who says he’s either moving to Hawaii or is already living in Hawaii. In this conversation, I feel like he’s not giving me a lot of choice in the matter. It feels frustrating, and I’m not entirely sure what we’re talking about. Then my ex shows up, or at least his voice does - I don’t actually see him. He tells me that he’s moving to Hawaii with the kids. In the conversation with my ex father in law it was apparent that I was going to need to stay in the house that I’m in and I can’t move anywhere because it’s my only place of residence. So when my ex tells me he’s moving to Hawaii with my kids, I’m pissed because I can’t get out of this house that I’m in. I’m super mad that they’re all in Hawaii. They’re not even from there. They’re just these white people who will just buy land and move there and my kids are going to be there without me to show them what Hawaii really is. I’m just mad that I’m stuck in this house. Somehow whatever agreement I’ve made with my ex father in law is keeping me stuck. Then I’m pissed at my ex because he just makes decisions about the kids without asking and just does whatever he wants.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,15/5/2020
65,,5/3/2020,"I’m with my friend Connie from high school. We are trying to host a roundtable discussion. We’re outside and there’s a picnic table. I think there’s some sort of event happening - maybe a fair or festival or something. We’re a part of that. She’s invited a bunch of people I don't really know. She’s hosting. I’m there observing and being moral support for her. The people who show up are all black men and women. I don’t recognize any of them except for two of them. King Noire shows up again and he is with his wife, Jet Setting Jasmine. They are together and with a bunch of other black people. They’re all talking about how we live in a culture of white supremacy and colonialism. There are also some people of color, so it’s not all black people. They are sitting at a picnic table sharing a meal together. There’s food and that seems to be an important piece in this dream. I’m hungry and I want to sit down and eat, but I have this very distinct feeling that I’m not welcome. I just want to listen in and support what they’re saying and learn from them. I think I’m really not welcome here. I don’t know if these are people who would want to break bread with me and share a meal with me. So I’m standing a little far away but still trying to listen. It’s getting heated. They’re getting very annoyed and pissed off about the different aspects of running a business in our society and also just walking down the street in our society. I’m feeling all of these emotions. I’m pissed that that’s their reality and mine. I’m pissed that I feel like there’s not a whole lot I can do to help change the situation so that it’s more equal and fair for everyone. I’m also aware that I can go over there and insert myself, but that would just be more of the same oppression and white privilege. So I am at a loss at what to do, besides listen. I’m watching interactions and watching people coming and going from this table. They’re sort of wrapping everything up. I can see they’re packing up and ready to go. I have a chance where the two pornstars, King Noire and Jet Setting Jasmine, are packing their stuff up and sort of on the side. I walk over to them and say, “Hey, I want you two to know that I’ve learned so much from the two of you. I listen to the podcast that you’re on and follow your instagram accounts and all the things you teach - your sex positive families instagram account. I really appreciate all of it.” As I’m telling them this, I still feel inadequate because I don’t have any money to buy their services or donate to their Venmo or anything. I’m in this predicament of wanting to pay and not having money to pay for their services. I am hoping that they receive my appreciation. But even then I can see that maybe they wouldn’t. I just find it incredibly frustrating to be in this place. They do listen, but I can’t tell if they appreciate what I’m saying or not. Then the dream changes at that moment. I’m in this dark twilight place - definitely shadowlands. There’s a wooded forest behind me. There’s a ghost town with all these boarded up shop fronts. I’m with my kids and my younger brothers and sisters, and they’re young. I’m a young adult in this place, or I’m me. But my kids and siblings are younger - all between 5 and 10 maybe. They’re playing and they’re hungry. They want something to eat. There’s a guy and in my head I’m thinking, “oh my god, pedophile.” I don't want anything to do with him. I am trying to keep the kids away from him while they’re playing. The kids say they’re really hungry and the guy is like, “Well, I have this refrigerator full of meat. You guys can just take out of it whatever you want.” I’m hungry, too. We’re all hungry. There’s also a train on train tracks moving through this part of town. The refrigerator full of meat is stuck in the middle of an open area. I don’t even know where it’s plugged into. It’s just there. I open up the refrigerator and start opening up the doors at the bottom. The meat is raw as if it has just been cut up. I go to pull it out. But I don’t want to take the meat from this guy because I don’t think his intentions are pure. I really want to get the kids away from him. He’s standing on a porch of one of these ghost buildings and he’s watching them play. I’m like, “Don’t even watch them play.” I’m trying to round the kids up and go back into the forest where it’s safer. I don’t ever accomplish this. We end up at a picnic table. The dream shifts again. I’m talking to two of my brothers - my older half brother and the brother that’s right after me. I’m not sure what we’re talking about. We are in a different place. They’re in a house they share together, which is up a grassy hill in the neighborhood I grew up in. The grassy hill and house they are living in actually (in waking life) belong to one of the kids I grew up with. The neighborhood has some trees, but for whatever reason the area they’re in is devoid of trees. It’s important for me to see that there are no trees on their property - and this isn’t true in waking life where there are trees lining the driveway. So I’m talking to them and I’m checking in with them. But part of me doesn’t want to be talking about this with them because they’re not listening to me. They’re not hearing me. I’m not getting a say. I’m not getting to use my voice about this. They’re just telling me how things are. I’m annoyed because that’s how it always is with them - they mansplain. They’re trying to show me how they have this whole new workout set-up. They have a crazy weight room and someone welded weights for them. They are explaining to me how they do it all. One part of me is just witnessing and is excited for them. I can tell they’re excited with this little boy exuberance - their weight room, their at-home gym. The other part of me is like, “Do you guys not remember that I have a degree in exercise science and could probably make you a much better workout than what you two are doing right now?” But they’re not listening and not open to it. I’m not saying anything. I’m just listening and letting them ramble on. Now they want to talk about how I should parent. At that point the dream fades into the mist - into grey.",Dreamer 8,Rose,BLM,19/5/2020
66,,6/3/2020,"I’m at work at the grocery store. I’m working in the frozen and dairy section. I’ve just arrived and I’m talking to the manager and she is giving me the rundown of all the things that need to be done today. She says, “Here’s your coat.” There’s an extra coat for me to wear because it’s cold in the freezer and she’s like, “Here’s some music you can listen to.” That’s awesome. I get ready to get all my stuff and go. I’m not sure if we’re in the breakroom when she’s giving me all this stuff. I walk out of that place. All of a sudden I have to get to the cooler to grab all the stuff out of the cooler to stock it. I’m in this gigantic huge grand ballroom. It’s like a maze. There are areas I’m trying to get through. A gala is happening. There’s a huge party. I have to go get the frozen or dairy foods for the party. I have to pull it out, so now I’m catering. It’s being put on by my brothers or a family member, maybe my mom. My mom actually does put on events in real life. So I’m trying to make my way to the cooler. It’s packed. It’s either so packed I can't move or I’m trying to obey the 6 feet distance rule and I’m having a hard time trying to get through the crowd and to the cooler. I have this cart - the carts we use in the back to load up our stuff. I’m trying to make my way, but then I hear the M.C. go: “And now, for our special guest, Arnold Schwarzenegger.” Sure enough, I look towards this doorway where people are coming in and out of. By the way, this is happening in a grand ballroom and there’s also a lawn and patio where this event is also happening. It’s a very big event. In the ballroom, the ceilings are so high I can’t even see the ceiling. The doorways are so tall, as you would see in a ballroom, that it takes a lot of effort just to open one door because the doors are so big and heavy. So these doors are open. The M.C. has announced Arnold Schwarzenegger and he walks through. What strikes me is the couple that walks before him, I think is my mom and dad, but it doesn’t look like them because these people are way tall and my parents aren’t particularly tall. Then, Arnold Schwarzenegger and his date or his wife walk through, also very tall. And then my brother and his fiancee walk through the door. My brother is just as tall as Arnold Schwarzenegger, so there are all these really tall people. I am sort of having this proud moment because I feel like this party or event is one my mom put on, but my brother is part of it and he made it happen. This was his vision and now here he is walking through the doors with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Then the next thought that goes through my head is like, “Wow, is Arnold Schwarzenegger such a B-List celebrity that he would agree to come to this gala event put on by my parents and brother?” Anyway, Arnold Schwarzenegger looks older, but not as old as he looks now. Then I am back to trying to get to the cooler so I can grab the stuff and bring it out for this party. The dream switches here. It goes from a beautiful gala party event with flower party arrangements and gold on the doors and on the walls, and the beautiful sconces and chandeliers, and just a very opulent setting to kind of dark, at least the lighting gets dark. I am watching these other people try to take over the ball. They have headsets on and they’re in a room where they’re watching everything on screens. They are trying to manage the ball from behind the scenes. They’re letting this centipede like creature with a round body- it’s like a toy from the 80s, that you could build bugs with, their bodies were really round and they have these yellow curly cue tongues and antennas and yellow peg legs you can put into the round bodies and make whatever size bug you wanted from these things. So, that’s what I’m watching these people do - they are going to let this bug loose on the party. But it’s a super poisonous bug like a centipede with a ton of legs. I’m still trying to do my part. But now I realize I need to stop this bug because if they let this bug go and it stings everyone, it’s going to be chaos and it’s not good. In my mind I think this bug is going to kill people. So I actually pick it up behind it’s first bulbous round head thing. It’s trying to move through the party, going back through the doors the others came out of. It’s getting bigger and smaller, changing size. When it’s in its small phase, I pick it up and it leaves one of its segments behind. I’m just really horrified that this bug is being let loose and I’m trying to contain it. When I do pick it up, it shrinks down to its toy size, even though it leaves its segments behind. But it’s still really poisonous. I don’t want the front end of it to get anywhere near to me - kind of like when you grab a snake behind the head so it can’t bite you, I’m trying to keep it from biting me and everyone else. There’s a little bit of panic and suspicion now going through the party. It was very joyful and joyous with the clink of china and all that stuff happening to silence and panic and fear, definitely fear. And the lighting is now dark.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,21/5/2020
67,,7/3/2020,"The dream starts with me in a car driving through rolling hills with big houses in the distance. It reminds me of a gated community. There’s lots of land. The parcels are huge and the houses are huge and there’s a lot of space between all of them. The hills are green and rolling. There’s a community center that we’re heading to. I get to this community center and home owners are coming and going. There are tables and chairs in one area and tv’s on the wall. Another area is like a nurse’s office. People are having their temperatures taken and getting shots. I think maybe they’re quarantining for coronavirus or giving vaccines. I’m not sure, but something like that is happening. I’m here. I get dropped off in this community center or clubhouse that the HOA owns. I’m watching people come and go - mostly white men. My ex father in law and ex show up. We have some interactions. I think I owe him some money and he wants the money from me. I don’t think I have everything I owe him, but I give him some. I’m reminding him we’re on a payment schedule and he’ll just have to wait for the rest. This part of the dream feels uncomfortable. I’m really not excited to see him or my ex. I don’t know what my ex wants. He’s just kind of there lurking. I’m really wanting to get away from both of them. They leave with some sort of promise from me that I’ll continue making my payments. I’m going from table to table in the clubhouse. I’m bored. I don’t know why I’m waiting or why I’m still there. For some reason I have to stay because I’m in quarantine of some sorts. There’s a nurse that comes in and gets me. I go into her office. I’m sitting on one of those benches with the paper on it. She’s taking my temperature and drawing my blood. She’s very friendly and I actually feel comfortable with her. While I’m in there, some of the wives of the owners of these houses come in and they’re all very chatty Kathy’s and dripping in jewelry and expensive stuff. I’m not. I’m wearing shorts and a tank top and slippers. Either the nurse or someone else who runs the clubhouse sees that I don’t look like the rest of them. She finds these strands, maybe 20 or 30 glass beads of all different colors. It’s a gorgeous necklace. She puts in on me and says, “Normally you’d have to pay for this, but I'm giving this to you. Don’t tell anybody I did.” It’s something she got from the gift shop part of the clubhouse. It’s this gorgeous necklace. She wraps it around twice and it looks beautiful on me. As soon as she does that, I'm suddenly no longer this misfit in the clubhouse, I’m queen. The energy changes. The other housewives, instead of just tolerating my presence, actually really begin to leave me alone in recognition of how much power I have. I get up and leave the nurse’s office and the clubhouse. I think I don’t need to be here. I go outside and there’s these huge trees - they look like oaks. There’s a storm, maybe a hurricane coming. Some of the husbands are trying to fortify the trees by raking the ground and moving the roots - trying to spread them wider so the trees will make it through this high wind. I’m watching them do this. Every time they try to move a limb or root to put it in the ground, I’m like, “Don’t touch the trees. You can’t change how they’re going to plant themselves or be.” I keep watching this one husband raking the ground. I see him take a fallen branch and try to plant it in the ground. It’s got all this green moss over the top of it. I see him plant it then turn around and move away. I watch as the tree just picks it up and moves it to where it wants it to be. These trees keep doing that. They keep moving their limbs to where they want them to be. I keep shaking my head at these men who think they’re going to be able to direct where the trees grow.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,30/5/2020
68,,8/3/2020,"It starts with me riding in a car with my lover. He starts out very attentive, as he should be, then he gets high and checks out. I’m not so stoked about it because we are headed to the pole studio where I’m going to practice. I’m not sure if he was going to work out or practice. It is a pole studio/gym so there is a place for him to go workout. It’s important that he works out and trains because there’s something he’s training for. I am training, too. We get to the pole studio. Unlike the pole studio I practice at, which is light and bright, this studio is pretty dark. The poles are so tall that the tops disappear into darkness. It’s almost like the studio is as big as an amphitheatre. I have a nagging feeling. There are other people training, I don’t know who they are, but they’re all women. We get there and I realize this pole studio and workout facility is owned by Wendy. Wendy is a woman I had a crazy emotionally abusive relationship with and she is now an ex-friend of mine. Going to a place she owns is filling me with dread. The reason we were heading that way is because of quarantine, so she wasn’t there. She was also pregnant and out of the picture, so it was safe for me to go there. Now she’s no longer pregnant and quarantine is over and she shows up and starts being a total tyrant. She hasn’t seen me though, so I hide. I lay on the ground and the other women - some are younger, maybe 12 or so - all sit on top of me and do a dance. They’re like the goddess with lots of arms. They do one of those dances where each arm goes in succession. They’re sitting on me so you can’t see my body at all - I’m covered and hidden. Somehow Wendy sees me anyway. She makes them stand up and get off me so she can see me. She just starts yelling at me - “Get on the pole! Do the moves!” I can’t. I’m tired and I haven’t done pole in a long time, so I don’t have the strength I usually have. This is really hard and I’m feeling attacked without resources to defend myself, just out of my own fatigue and because my nervous system is shocked from being in her presence. She is a tyrant. She’s wearing a ballet bodysuit with one of those ballet skirts that go straight out. It looks funny on her because her body is very beefy. She’s barking orders at everyone. I feel so attacked and I really want to get out of there, but I can’t find my lover. He actually shows up, but he kind of fawns to her. She intimidates him, as well. The whole situation feels gross. One part of me is going, “Oh my god, you’re not actually a victim, you could get out of this at any time.” But in the dream I’m being taken through this tyrant-victim dynamic and my lover is not defending himself because he’s high and he’s also not defending me. I’m upset about it. Then we have a dream shift. There’s a battlefield. I’m observing and not partaking in this part of the dream. Soldiers are coming in off the ocean. We’re on a beach. The ones coming in off the ocean have more primitive weapons, like lances. The soldiers maintaining the beach have guns and bombs. It’s a fucking slaughter. The ocean is red from blood. There are bodies floating everywhere and bodies on the sand. I know that the soldiers on the beach are Japanese. They come from the samurai background but are not using their samurai honor at all. Then as I’m observing, I pull back from the beach and am in a bunker. It has one window that I can see out of. There are a bunch of men - generals I think - sitting around a table and looking at a map. I’m not participating - I’m observing all of this. I look to my right and there is one window where you can see and hear the ocean. As I’m looking, a gigantic sneaker wave is coming right towards this bunker and is going to come right through this window. I think, “Why would you build a bunker so close to the ocean. You have to know there are tides and the water can get you at any point. This is way too close to the water.” I just watch as this huge wave comes and covers the bunker. The bunker is concrete, so it’s not going anywhere, but the water that comes in the window is going to get everyone. The water gets up to the window, then the dream shifts. So I don’t actually see the water come into the bunker. I don’t see what happens to the rest of the fighting. The last impression I have is a lot of dead bodies. And it’s all men. The dream shifts and I’m on a school campus. I cross a bridge and go from the dorms which are in a forest. The forest is beautiful and the trees are not really big around. They are smaller and remind me of young eucalyptus trees. The bark is that creamy pale mixed with red. There is a lot of space, paths, fairy lights and lightning bugs. It’s pretty magical. As soon as I cross the bridge everything changes and I can tell I’m in an academic setting. In front of me are buildings. People - professors and other college students - are coming at me. They’re hurrying here and there. To my right there is a stream or creek - it’s not a river. It’s this gorgeously stepped hillside that goes down. It’s not man made steps, just natural levels that go down. It’s emerald green - grass, moss and tiny moss flowers. The roots from trees make each level. I’m walking down towards the stream because I’m having an aversion to going to school or towards the college. I can actually see myself squatting next to the stream. I have a backpack on, but I really don’t want to go to school. I do meet with someone. There is a conversation, but I don’t remember what it is. I can see myself squatting down next to the water. This piece feels magical, like a continuation of the forest. There is a line where you can see you step into academia where it is grey and the energy is grey. I just don’t head that direction even though I need to - there is stuff I need to do and papers I need to write. Then the dream shifts again. I’m in a garden, the kind with well trimmed hedges that make a kind of labyrinth. I’m meeting this older woman with grey hair. She reminds me of Glenn Close when she played Cruella De Vil in “101 Dalmations” or in the movie, “The Devil Wears Prada.” She’s totally a bitch and stalking around. I don’t think I’m her apprentice, but there’s some sort of power dynamic where I’m supposed to be doing things for her. I keep doing them wrong and I’m not wearing the right clothes. I get three tries. We meet together three different times. Each time I’m wearing a different outfit and I’ve brought something for her from a task I was supposed to complete. I don't remember what they were. What I do remember is that each time she sees my clothes, she’s so disappointed that I haven’t dressed the part and I don't look like her assistant or her apprentice. She says I look sloppy. She’s super verbally abusive the first two times. On the third time, I pop out and it’s not me as her apprentice. It’s someone else and I’m observing. This time I watch as she’s super physically violent with the woman who is her apprentice. She pushes her through a scratchy thorny hedge and then pushes her down into the water. The woman’s clothing is actually really lovely. She has white satin slingback high heels on and a nice coat and gloves. Each time she has met, the clothing has changed. This time, the Glenn Close character holds her down under the water and ruins the shoes and coat. I can tell there was no way this woman or me was ever going to do it right and this other woman is just crazy abusive. Then the dream switches again. I make music - I’m a music artist. I’ve made a song and it’s gone to be judged and given an award. I can clearly see recording equipment in front of me. I’m sitting on a couch and singing. As I sing, I splice in somebody else who is rapping, then I go back to singing. It’s very formulaic - a lot of songs on the radio sound like this. I am hearing the song in my head and don’t think it’s really special. It is very formulaic - just like what every producer puts out these days with collaborations between famous people, but don’t really mean a whole lot. The words aren’t really inspiring and neither is the melody or tune or anything. But I put it out and somehow I get an award for this piece. I’m sitting on this couch and the people who bring me the award are two young Japanese men who are apprenticed to a master. They are maybe in their twenties. I can see the master in the background, but the two that come are men. They come one at a time. They are holding these gold statues of a record player. Their feet are shuffling as they approach me. They have it held out in front of them, then they bow and hand it to me. Someone is announcing in the background that I’ve won these awards. But I’m still on this couch where I can see through the walls and see the outside. I can actually see the doorframe that these Japanese men are walking through, but there are no walls on either side and the door frame itself is translucent - I can see through it. I can also see through the doorway because I can see them coming. So the first one comes and hands me the award and bows and leaves. Then the MC makes another announcement to say I’ve won another award. The second Japanese man comes shuffling towards me and bows with a lot of humility. So now I have these two awards. Then this other woman shows up. She looks like Lana del Ray, but a really young version of her. She goes, “I don't know why you won. Your song is not that good.” She plays me her song that was in the same category as mine. Her song is beautiful and her voice is beautiful - it’s haunting. However, it has the same formula. She sings, then somebody raps, then she sings and somebody raps. I’m going like, “Yeah, why did my song win? Her song is way more beautiful than mine.” She goes, “I think you copied me. You just stole it.” I was like, “Well, no, I definitely did not steal it. Mine is not even close to as good as yours.” It just feels like a strange thing. Those awards I won feel right. I did earn the awards according to the criteria. I did feel a sense of accomplishment. But when I compare it to what she’s created, I’m like, “Whoa, you definitely deserve awards for what you’re doing. I don’t understand why you didn’t get any.” So she comes at me with some competitive energy, but I am not feeling the competition. I agree with her. I think she should have won some awards.",Dreamer 8,Rose,election,31/5/2020
69,,9/3/2020,"I’m with my son and we are going to an event - it’s a game you play and you can win money if you get the answers right, kind of like Jeopardy or something. We walk into what looks like a sound studio or stage where they film shows. The game is you answer a bunch of questions. You read or watch a little video clip and then you answer questions about it. My son is about 10 or 11 in the dream. I’m like, “Let’s go do this! It will be fun.” He’s kind of dubious. I’m also a little dubious. I’m looking at myself and my focus is on things like social justice and astrology, but we’re going to do this trivia type thing and it’s all shit I don’t know. The crowd is all white people who, for lack of a better term, look like white trash that watches Ricki Lake. This is my impression. Sure enough, all of the questions are about shit I know nothing about. In my perspective, these questions are really dumb. We’ve answered 5 or 6 questions and I’ve gotten all of them wrong or I haven’t answered them at all because I didn’t know the answer. I’m winning $0. The crowd is booing me and can’t believe I don’t know the answers to any of these things. I’m going like, “Well, this is shit I don’t care about, so of course I don’t know the answers.” All of this stuff is really important to them and the answers to the questions are really easy for them. I’m completely clueless. Their judgment and my judgment are super real. My son is looking at me like, “Mom, this is not fun.” I’m like, “Yeah, this is not fun at all.” I’m wanting to leave because I honestly don’t know any of the answers for any of this and it is not a comfortable situation being jeered at and teased and not winning any prizes.",Dreamer 8,Rose,BLM,11/6/2020
70,,10/3/2020,"There’s a talk show happening. I’m watching it but also engaging in it and participating. I’m on the set. I’m there in real time. It’s a bunch of young teenage girls. They’re all wearing some version of a blue knit sweater. They are all from the same school so this is a uniform but they’ve each made it their own. They’re European or Swedish by nationality, but ethnicity ranges with Asian girls and black girls. They’re all female-bodied and from this one school. They’re sitting in rows in desks and I’m facing them, looking at them. There’s a big green screen behind them. To their right is a male teacher/interviewer. He is asking them these trivia quotations and they’re answering. But he’s a little bit off. Every once in a while he says something that’s super off-color or super sexist or just super objectifying. At one point I hear him saying, “And don’t they all have glorious tits?” I’m like, “What the fuck did he just say?” He says that kind of stuff, but the girls, instead of taking offense, they just own it and make it their own - not in the giggling way and giving away of power, but in a “oh so you noticed, idiot, good.” It’s a very interesting dynamic. But they’re still young. I can feel they’re young and they don’t know everything because they haven’t experienced everything. It’s just so strange. This is all being televised and people are watching. At some point, my focus shifts from these young ladies to the show host. He kind of beckons me over. He wants me to look at the green screen. So I get close to him and say, “Okay, what do you want?” He says, “Look really carefully at this screen.” On the green screen is a map of the world. He says, “They’re only showing you part of it.” As he says that, suddenly all these spots on the green screen that are showing the globe burst into flames - not physical flames, but a simulation of flames that are all over the world. He says, “They’re not showing you everything. The world is on fire in so many more ways and places than you think.” I’m like, “Oh god!” kind of like conspiracy theory style, but also not - just the plain facts that there is so much more burning than we think. In part of the show he was asking these young ladies, “What do you think of environmentalism? What do you think about racism?” As in what are your solutions? What can we do about it? It’s been a very interesting dynamic where with his questions he is teasing out their knowledge and their wisdom, but also saying really fucked up things and showing how this world is on fire in ways that we don’t know and places that we don’t know. Be aware that there’s so much more going on. Then the dream shifts to the shores of a beach - it’s super rugged and rocky, but not too windy. The sun is out. There’s a breeze. My son is with me. We’re going to a picnic or barbecue with people. There are all kinds of people. My son is at my shoulder and his presence stays with me, but he wanders off to go play and have fun. I’m watching these men. Some are black and some I don’t know their color. They’re tossing a football and I’m like, “I want to play.” They throw me the football and I’m throwing it with a really good spiral. The thought crosses my mind: “Wow, there’s a lot of sun. I’m glad I have sunscreen on my face and my hair.” But then I look down and I’m wearing one of these tops from when I was a kid. It’s an 80’s crop top with elastic on the bottom and top and you can pull it down off the shoulders and there’s a ruffle, so the ruffle is on the top and you pull it down over your shoulders. It’s a gross, not attractive cream color. It has way too much yellow in it. It’s not a good color on me. I look down and all of that skin that is exposed - over the shoulders and top of the chest - is burnt.The rest of me had sunscreen on, but that is burnt. I’m like, “Oh god!” and realize that I need to get into the shade. It’s interesting, this scene begins with a rugged beach and coastline, but there’s grass where I’m throwing the football, and past that are trees - a forest of oak trees, really gentle. I give up playing football because I realize how burnt I am. I’m walking toward the trees because I want to get into the shade. I pass two black women sitting on the grassy part. They are having their lunch and talking. I notice how they have their eyes on me as I’m walking past. They were relaxed and laughing and enjoying each other, but as soon as I get close, their entire demeanor and bodies change to this wariness like, “Oh god, what is this white girl going to say? What is she going to do?” It breaks my heart because I see them disappear and I see them tracking me to make sure I’m not going to do anything. I try to make a joke how I managed to burn the fuck out of my skin. They do the polite laugh, but there’s not real connection. It’s fucking heartbreaking because I want that real connection. So I continue on to get out of their space and head to the trees, so I can take care of my burn. Then I get into the trees and the scene changes again. Now I see a walkin to a freezer and a supply closet where there are tasks to do. There’s a crew of us. We’re in some sort of building - maybe a grocery store. There’s a really low ceiling and I’m feeling quite claustrophobic. There is a manager and I don’t know them in real life. The manager is handing out tasks for everyone to do. A lot of the people have been given tasks where they have to leave this small space then come back. But I am not. The task they give me makes me stay in this small space where I feel so claustrophobic and cold. I’m going in and out of this walkin freezer and this space that feels like a supply closet. It’s so crowded and there’s not a lot of room. I’m looking at the manager like, “Can I get a different job? This is so tedious and so claustrophobic.” The manager is like, “Nope, this is the one you have.” I’m like, “Yeah, but I could do a job where I can be outside and move my body. I’m just stuck in this spot doing this very tedious, repetitive task.” I think the task is cleaning the shelves or something. I am like, “This is not going to last long.” No, just no. I’m feeling boxed in and just doing something that does not use my skills to the best of my ability, but the manager is stubborn about me doing it. It’s frustrating.",Dreamer 8,Rose,environment,12/6/2020
71,,11/3/2020,"It’s dark or nighttime. There are a bunch of us, all young, maybe teenagers or early twenties. The only person I recognize is my friend, Nani from high school. We’re all being trained to fly airplanes. It’s wartime. These are the kind of planes you see from old photos - the original planes that are all open with no cockpit and only room for one person. The airplanes are all lined up and we’re all lined up getting into our airplanes. I’m getting into my airplane and am wearing shorts - not enough clothes. So I suddenly think I should get some more clothes on. I have some because we are all packed and ready to go. I get some of the clothes out and put them on. I get in the airplane. We’re learning how to fly and have never taken a plane up before. It’s time to go fly these planes now. I’m a little panicked because I don’t feel like I know how to really fly the plane yet. But we go. The airplanes in front of me each start to take off. Then I take off. I’m flying okay. We’re all supposed to meet someplace before we head off to our attack. As I’m flying the plane, my heart is pounding because I don’t feel I have this down. I fly over this school. It’s a college - an old college with buildings with spires and ivy covering the brick walls. I’m flying over and around and I am trying to catch up with the group. I’m having a hard time flying the plane and end up going in circles around this college. I do end up landing the plane on a rooftop. It’s still dark - nighttime. I land the plane and get out on the roof. I climb down the wall and am looking in the windows of the building. There are kids inside. I climb down like I’m going to do some reconnaissance. The whole time I’m panicking that I’m not with the rest of the planes. I’m not really sure what it is I’m doing now, why I’m there or what I’m looking for. I am looking for something, though. There are tall trees on this campus. Then the dream switches and I’m wandering around a downtown I don’t recognize in real life. I see my older brother and he has a motorcycle. The motorcycle is light-weight. I’m not having any problem holding it and getting on it. There is a single battery or motor that you put on it. Without this battery, it’s just a bike. With the battery in it, I can ride it like a motorcycle. My brother and I are outside this building. It’s a rectangular, two-story building. You have to go downhill to a parking lot and walk upstairs to a restaurant at the top. He’s been working at the restaurant. He tells me to take the motorcycle and learn how to ride it. So again, I’m trying to learn how to work something that I don’t know how to ride. I say okay because I’ve always wanted to learn how to ride a motorcycle. But I don’t know how to shift gears with my hands. Somehow I manage it on my first ride. I ride around and I’m back in this downtown area. There is a little popcorn shop or I have an idea that I want to sell popcorn, but I’m like, “There was a popcorn shop down here once before and it failed, so that’s actually a terrible idea. Plus the overhead of having a cute little shop downtown where all you’re selling is popcorn is never going to add up. I will never make it.” These thoughts are going around in my head and I’m still on this motorcycle which I’ve parked. I went into a shop to talk to an owner about my idea. They’re encouraging me to do it. But I’m like, “It makes no sense to open a popcorn shop.” So I figure out that none of this is a good idea. The shop I’m in is narrow. It has really narrow walkways or pathways. I have to turn sideways to get through some of the places. So I leave this shop. I go to get on the motorcycle. But when I get to it, it’s a bike. The battery/motor is gone. I don’t know where it is. Now I’m just riding a regular bicycle, but the seat is really tall and the handlebars are really tall. I struggle to get on the thing, but I manage to. Now that I’m on it, I can see everybody and everything - I’m looking down at cars and people and I’m tall enough to see into the second story windows. I just want to go home. I’m ready to go home and get off this bike. I don’t know what happened to the battery thing. I want to be riding a motorcycle, not a super tall bike. I’m frustrated. It’s still dark. I am riding the bike through the streets and having a hard time because it’s really tall. My balance is not great and I’m afraid I’m going to fall off. I know which direction I need to go to go home and I have to keep going to my right because my home is in that direction and right is north. I just know I have to go that way, but it doesn’t matter to me how I’ll get home because I know all the roads will eventually get me there. So I’m riding, riding, riding, and think I’ll just take the roads in front of me and as long as I bear to the right most of the time, I should be fine. This pudgy young man with short dark curly hair, pale skin, glasses, khaki pants and short-sleeved collar shirt - very not threatening - is also riding his bike. He’s like, “Where are you going?” I say, “I’m just heading home.” He says, “I’ll ride with you for a little bit.” We start to get reckless, blowing through stop signs and not looking for cars. Because my bike is so tall, I go through a stop sign and this car comes and hits me. But my bike is so big that I roll over the back of the car and we keep going. There isn’t even really an impact. It bumps me, but that’s it. Both of us are riding through streets and at one point I ride through this kids playground. The kids have made all of these garden beds, and I’m like, “Oh god! I don’t want to ride over their garden beds.” So I veer off to the right and ride through their compost piles instead. As I’m riding through these streets, I’m riding over train tracks really quick. This guy that is with me is keeping up. He’s on a much lower bike - one of those recumbent bikes. We’re just having fun. It’s definitely reckless. I’m looking at some of the street signs and one of the streets I ride down is Queen Street. One of the streets I ride down has a tree tunnel. One of the streets is a hill I have to ride up, but it doesn’t seem to bother me and I’m not breathing hard. It’s no problem for me to get up this hill, even though it’s pretty steep. We’re flying through parts of town. I keep taking the road that goes to the right. That’s where the dream ends with me riding through all these streets with this guy. He does eventually veer off to the left to go home and says, “Okay, this is where we part ways.” I just keep riding, always to the right. Then the dream ends.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,15/6/2020
72,,12/3/2020,"I’m visiting my friend Emma - she’s a psychic, an intuitive. We are sitting down having a conversation but I can’t remember what the conversation is about. The scene changes to this huge outdoor party. It’s all of these schools and students who are graduating. My high school classmates are there. My parents are there, too. We’re at a pool. It’s like the pools at the Hilton Hawaiian - super long and winding with different sections. I am with my parents. They’re here to celebrate - maybe me...but I don’t know who exactly is graduating. I just know that it’s a huge party outdoors at this poolside. We’re riding on little rafts through the pool area. There are famous people who we want to meet. I don’t recognize them and don’t know who they are in this realm, but in the dream they are famous people. I feel like I’ve met them already and had conversations with them. They seemed pretty cool and humble. I wasn’t extremely starstruck or anything. When I meet them in the dream, everything is really chill and there’s no weirdness about them being stars. In other words, there’s no hierarchy. Then my parents show up and my friends show up and are like, “Yeah, we’re going to meet these people!” So we get on this little raft that takes us from one side of the pool to the other, so we’ve crossed some sort of threshold. The famous people are at this one table. My parents are like, “Come here, we’re going to sit here.” We all (me, my parents and some of my classmates) begin to squeeze in close around these famous people. I’m feeling like this is so awkward. My attention is on my friends, siblings and my parents and I’m talking to them instead of the famous people. I don’t want to be fawning over them - it feels gross. Then we’re all sitting at this table. Somebody starts to announce awards and whatnot. The people who are lined up across the pool on the other side are cheering and we’re cheering. There’s a lot of celebrating happening. The party disperses. For whatever reason, I haven’t eaten and a lot of people have not eaten. We’ve been sitting there watching shows. I think food was being served, but I’m not eating - I don’t know if it’s because I just can’t because I’m allergic or what. Everyone disperses for playtime because the award ceremony is over. Everyone is playing in the pool. There are huge waterslides and I go down a waterslide a few times. I’m in a swimsuit. I’m hungry though. The hunger is starting to get intense. And everybody is hungry. There wasn’t enough food. A lot of the parents are gone at this point and there are just a bunch of younger kids playing around. We find these meat sticks - they come in pairs of two and are wrapped in plastic. Everyone is given a meat stick. I go to eat it because I'm ravenous. But I take one bite and my stomach is like, “Oh hell no!” As I’m watching some of the other kids with meat sticks, everybody is chowing down because they’re so hungry. But they’re swimming through the pool and all of the grease from the meat sticks is coming out of the package and now it’s in the pool. I’m standing on the side of the pool with this meat stick I don’t want. I think I give it away at some point. I’m watching other people swim in the water with their meat sticks and making the water greasy. Some of the other people that are with me are kids and I think they’re models because they’re really tall and skinny. I think, “Wow, they’re just going after these meat sticks. They taste kind of gross and I can’t believe they’re eating them. And they’re getting them in the water. I don’t want to get in the water anymore.” But I need to get from one side of the pool to the other. So I’m swimming through this greasy water and it’s grossing me out. No amount of chlorine is going to get this grease off of me. Then the dream shifts. I’m observing and a bit disembodied. I see an AI - a robot. He’s on a planet and his spaceship has crashed. His AI pet is going to run off and has gotten really wild. This AI pet can morph like a transformer. It can be really huge or really tiny. It can be all kinds of things. He’s trying to retain his AI pet, but also trying to fix his spaceship which has crashed on the side of a mountain. The topography is all sand and sand dunes and rocks. There is one episode where he is trying to talk to his AI pet and it’s huge - it has transformed into a huge transformer size. I’m somehow partnered with him and he’s fighting his pet. He’s rolling in the dirt and avoiding being stepped on. At one point I see his AI pet has a metal leg that looks like a chicken leg. They are both made of metal. I see this three or four-toed metal foot come down and try to smash the AI guy. He rolls out of the way. It’s very dramatic, like the scene from a movie. Then somehow the guy scares off his pet for the moment while telling it to behave itself and transform back into something more manageable. So the AI pet runs off down this canyon to go have a timeout and think about what it’s done. There’s a threat of humor throughout this whole part even though it’s very serious because the AI guy is upset that his pet has gotten so out of control. He’s also upset because his aircraft has crashed and he needs to fix it. The AI guy climbs up this rocky cliff face to his craft that’s crashed on this precarious ledge. He goes inside and I watch him. He’s unscrewing the screws around this gigantic pane of glass that has all these etchings that are like a control center. He’s like, “Yep, I’ve got this. I know how to fix this. I just need to take these screws out and the glass is going to fall towards me.” He is in what looks like the cockpit of his craft. You can stand up in it. It’s round with a flat floor. As he takes off the last screw out and the glass falls out and you see it fall. It lands on these tall spires of rock that are below him on the cliff face mountain. The glass cracks and spiders everywhere. In my mind in the dream, I’m laughing because it’s so comical that the glass fell the wrong way and he’s going to have to fix that now. I don’t even know if he can fix it. He’s like, “Yep, I got this.” He says something funny as it falls down. Now I’m thinking, “Oh my god, now you’re really screwed. Then he goes back to fixing other parts of the craft. It’s like I’m seeing a montage of him fixing parts. The montage slows down where he asks for his breakfast and I hand him his breakfast. All I can see is my hand and my hand is human. I hand him a hard boiled egg, but it’s still soft. He cracks it open and I watch him. The outside of the egg is deep red - not like we’re used to. He peels the shell off and cuts it in half with his fingernail. He goes to eat it and it’s soft boiled, so he’s slurping it. I ask him, “How do we win this?” He says, “You have to tip it towards the side of wanting?” In the dream, I’m asking how we are going to get the ship fixed and how he is going to get his AI pet back. But in my mind in this realm, I’m asking how do we stop the racism, how do we stop killing each other, how do we change the paradigm, and how do we get out from under whatever it is that’s trying to feed off our emotions all the time and keep us in fear and keep us fighting each other and keep us in this vibration of discrimination and being against each other and hating each other. I wake up to a song in my head: “I’m ready to match the rhythm to the beat.”",Dreamer 8,Rose,BLM,17/6/2020
73,,13/3/2020,"This dream starts with Dana and I. We’re together and learning about anti-racism. We’re learning from King Noire and his wife, Jet Setting Jasmine. We’re all at a movie theater. They want us to watch a movie as part of our anti-racism education. Their son Majesty is with them. He’s two. Jasmine is breastfeeding him and we’re all watching. I’m uncomfortable. I’m feeling unsure and I don't know what we’re going to watch. These two people are so solid in who they are, what they know and how they show up in the world. I don’t want to harm them in any way or disrespect them in any way, and I’m white. So I’m nervous. We’re watching the movie and Jasmine is nursing the baby. The movie is over and Jasmine gives me Majesty to hold. I'm like, “What do I do with Majesty?! I’m not nursing and I can’t feed him!” I have this feeling that I can’t provide for him or nourish him. But I do know how to hold a baby because I have two kiddos. I take him and I’m nervous. We leave the theater and now Dana and I are just with King and Majesty. We’re now at a convention center. There are multiple rooms with different spaces. Each room has a different conference or panel or presenter. Dana goes off because she is going to learn from somebody. I am still with King and still have Majesty. I hand Majesty to King and he drops him. I’m like, “Oh my god, you just dropped the baby!” I go to pick up the baby and Majesty’s whole body is rigid. His back is arching and his mouth is pulled back in a rictus grin. I’m like, “Oh no!” I’m afraid his back has been broken. King is looking at me like, “What are you going to do?” I’m like, “Uh, you just dropped your baby. What am I going to do?” Then I realize Majesty’s body is going into the typical trauma response from rigidity to shaking it out. So if I just hold him while his body does his thing, he’s going to be okay. So I just hold him and let his body do that. When he’s done, I hand him back to King. The scene shifts a little and I walk into an amphitheatre. I’m going to watch a performance. Everybody in the crowd is dressed to the nines like they’re going to see an opera. In the front row I see Nani, Janet and Shawna who are my three friends from high school that I used to hang out with. I see them and am pretending not to see them because I don't want to talk to them. But they see me and I see them track me. I walk past them and sit. I watch the performance (I don’t remember what it was). The performance ends and I walk out of the theatre. I’m in the lobby now and the lobby looks an awful lot like the lobby of the theatre at the high school I went to. It was called Gates Theatre because that was the last name of the people who donated enough money to build it. The three of them call my name and are like, “Rose! Hi! We see you.” I’m like, “Eh, hi!” But I don’t want to talk. In Junior year of high school, Nani and Janet dropped me from the friend group and Shawna went with another friend group so I was left with no friends in my junior year. In my senior year, Nani moved away, but she sent me a letter apologizing for ostracizing me and leaving me out. I realize this is my hesitation. They always show up in my dreams and I'm like, Eh. They’re like, “How are you?” I look at them and am like, “You know what, I’m great, I’m fine.” I don’t want to do small talk. But Nani wants a hug, so I guess I’ll hug her. Then I get away as quickly as I can. I go sit on a barstool at a tall table. My classmate Ikaika who I've known since second grade cruises by. He does this double take because I don’t look how I used to look and it’s not just age - I’ve had a nose job since my brother broke my nose and I just look different than I did in high school. He’s trying to figure out who it is. I’m like, “Hey Ikaika, it’s Rose.” He goes, “Oh my god!” He’s doing the double take thing and side eye thing that men do when they see an attractive woman. He's like, “You are so beautiful. You are gorgeous.” I’m like, “Yup!” I hug him hello and we do some small talk and then he goes on his way. Then the dream comes back around to King Noire and anti-racism and sex work. Now I’m in a car with King. It’s a Cadillac and the top is down. We’re driving through a city and through some shady neighborhoods. I’m taking everything in. My jaw is dropped. He’s talking to me about sex, anti-racism and social justice. I can’t recall his exact words. He’s teaching and I’m listening. We end up near a river. There’s a shell floaty - like Aphrodite. He’s like, “Okay, now here’s the part of your education around sex.” I’m looking at him like, “What are you talking about?” Oh, I’ve been eating blueberries and they’re so sweet - they’re the most magical delicious blueberries that have ever existed. I climb on the shell and I have the blueberries. I’m wearing a skirt. King offers me the rest of the blueberries: “Take as many as you want because these are the last of them. So I put the blueberries in my lap right over my pussy. I’m eating them and am reclined back in this shell that is now floating down the river. King is like, “Now it’s time for your sex education.” There are so many feelings and thoughts and I’m like, “I don't know what to do!” He leans over me and starts to eat the blueberries out of my lap where I have them nestled in my skirt. I’m like, “Oh hell yes!” When I look up, I realize he’s completely naked and he’s leaning over me from the top. So it’s like yes, his penis is right in my face. I’m like, “Oh! I know what to do with this!” From that point forward, all of my “oh my god I don't know what’s happening” thoughts change to “oh I don’t need to be an expert, I know what to do with what's in front of me.” There’s this beautiful dick hanging in front of my mouth and I am definitely going to suck on that. It’s a knowing. This part ends with us 69’ing in a shell floating down a river in a city by some shady neighborhoods. It’s not a problem! I realize I was just getting in my own way of things I was trying to learn. The whole time King was being very stern and very king-like. There’s a recognition of King and his wife - they are so centered, they know who they are, they know what they’re doing here, they know their worth, they don't fucking question it, they just are king and queen. The whole time I didn’t know if I was worthy. But by the end of the dream, I knew what to do and realized this is very human. What else would you do if I had a lapful of blueberries?!",Dreamer 8,Rose,BLM,18/6/2020
74,,14/3/2020,"I’m going to see my lover. He’s working out in the forest. There’s a complex of a bunch of buildings where he’s working with a bunch of his buddies. One building is a dorm. There’s another building where they eat. I have work to do, too. I’m out there and thinking I’ll do this work with him. He’s really not happy to see me. He’s really pissed off that I’m in his space. I’m pouring moon blood into containers that look like Monday-Friday pill containers. Instead of just seven compartments, there’s a whole sheet of them, so there’s probably 24 compartments, maybe 36. I have three sheets of them. My moon blood is in a jar where I’ve collected it and I’m just pouring it into each of these sheets and trying to make it an even amount in each. There’s a presence of my son, but he’s not actually there. My lover has stopped whatever work he was doing and he’s upset. He’s like, “I told you I needed space. Why are you here? Don’t come out here.” I say, “Well I’m actually here to do work.” He says, “Don’t lie to me. I know you’re here to see me.” I’m feeling hurt and confused. I’m not really sure why I’m out there except I am happy to see him. He leaves the area and takes me with him, but he’s not happy about it. I’m not happy about it now either, because he’s being a bit of a dick. He’s asking me all kinds of questions like, “What are you doing out here? What is your job? Why are you out here? What are your long term goals?” He’s asking all these questions that I don’t have answers for and it feels like an attack. It doesn’t feel kind. Then other stuff happens that I can’t remember. In the last scene, I’m with a client of mine who is getting married. It’s the day of the wedding and I’m there as an officiant. I’m also there to set up the wedding. It’s the second time she’s trying to get married. The first time everything got shut down because of coronavirus. A lot of the supplies we need for getting ready are not there. I’m trying to make these burlap pumpkins as part of the decor. I’m just making do with what I’ve got because I can’t find some of the supplies I used last time when I was getting everything ready for the wedding, but it didn’t happen. This time I’m trying to do my best with what I’ve got. My client is really excited. She’s trying on her wedding dress. She’s showing it to me. We’re in this room that’s part of a bigger hall where she’s getting married. Her bridesmaids are there and there are other people. It’s going to work even though it got canceled once and we don’t have all the supplies we had last night. We’re still making the wedding work and she still looks beautiful. There’s joy in this part of the dream.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,22/6/2020
75,,15/3/2020,"It looks like a post-apocalyptic city where things have been destroyed or burned down. I’m with my friend Emma and her partner. The two of them are showing me around the city. They’re showing me places where statues have been pulled down and things have been destroyed. All the things that have been destroyed are the white male patriarchy tributes to other white males. We’re in a park. The grass is still green - Gaia is doing just fine in the dream. But all things human-made are falling down and in disrepair. I see a lot of steel and metal that’s been pulled down. It’s all crooked and bent and broken in places. She’s telling me, “They don’t see us and they don’t honor us. They don’t care for us and they don’t put us first. That’s why it all has to come down.” Then the dream shifts and I’m with my ex. His girlfriend is with him. She’s a younger blonde woman. I walk up to her and say, “We haven’t met because this idiot has never introduced us. My name is Rose and I’m the mother of those two children over there.” The kids are in this part of the dream, too. We’re in a neighborhood. They’ve moved and they’re showing me their new house. I’m seeing where they live now so I can pick up the kids when it’s my turn. She’s actually quite easy to get along with and there's a good vibe between us. My ex is still annoying. He’s just combative with me. He’s trying to talk to me, but the tone in his voice is so condescending and really forceful. There’s no room for discussion with him. He’s just giving ultimatums. I’m not feeling like listening to that, so I ignore him as usual. I go over to see the kids. The kids are kind of squirrely. My son is happy to see me; my daughter, not so much. They’re both really clear that they want to live with their dad in this house that he and his girlfriend have. The house has swings in the front yard and a waterslide. There are lots of fun things to do here, so of course the kids are going to pick that. Then the scene shifts again. I’m in a downtown area in a community center. It’s run by people of color. It’s an education center where you can come learn about the different cultures and histories of other places. The history of the U.S. is also being taught, but it’s all the stuff we were never taught in school. It’s all the stuff that was not whitewashed and what is coming out now in real time about the history of the peoples here and how they were treated. The emphasis is on the culture. It’s all young women in this place, except for a few young men who are coming and going and some two-spirit or trans people. A young woman stops me. They are excited to show me all the stuff I never knew about their country and where they come from - their history, their roots. I’m having this crazy moment of realizing how little I do know and how exciting it is to observe these young people and absorb their love for their country and where they came from. I’m also excited to learn there is so much more to life than I thought. It’s fantastic and amazing. Instead of me feeling put upon or defensive, I’m very excited by this treasure trove of knowledge and that these people are so excited to teach. There are a few people within the community center who are a bit contemptuous of me and what they would call my ignorance. But overall, there is an excitement to share. Even though I’m the ignorant white woman, there is still tolerance because I'm there to learn and am excited to learn about all these things, especially the cultural aspects. At one point I pick up a wooden carving of India. What I notice is that unless the person hadn’t told me it was India, I wouldn’t have known what country it was. I had a moment of shame that I should have known what country this was. But I didn’t know and the shapes of the countries change all the time, so now I do know.",Dreamer 8,Rose,environment,7/7/2020
76,,16/3/2020,"I’m driving a car. My mom is in the passenger’s seat. We’re road tripping and there are spots we have planned. At one point, I’m not paying attention and totally cross the center line and almost nail an oncoming car. My mom was freaking out in the passenger seat, as she should. I get back in my lane and we make our first stop at this house of a friend of mine and my ex’s relatives. This house is kind of cool. It’s a bunch of millennials and their focus is on social justice. They all share the house. They do lots of things together. Everything is focused on quality conversation and connection and conflict resolution, which when you live with a bunch of roommates is probably a good idea! They really go out of their way to connect. They play games to connect. They welcome us into the house and show us our bedrooms and everything. They invite us to play one of their games. I kind of lose track of my mom at this point. I think she’s there, but I’m not totally sure; she just kind of fades into the background. The young woman who is the person I know has dark curly hair down to her shoulders, Latina, shares a room with another woman who is her girlfriend. There are two or three men that all share a room. One man is gay. There’s only one white man in the entire house. It’s so interesting. I’m noticing all of this. They’re starting to play a game and the game is hard to explain - they are explaining to me a set of rules. There’s an activity for us to do and we all do the activity in our own way. At one point this activity takes us all out of the house. I find myself in a mall then back in the front yard of the house. At one point, there is a little bit of conflict, but I watch as they really calmly and with a lot of emotional intelligence explain their side and listen without judgment. Everyone is speaking with the “I feel” and “I experience” and “When this happened, it made me feel like this” language. Everyone is really supportive of each other and cheering each other on as we each take turns in playing our part in this game. It’s super civil. Part of me is observing this whole thing and like, “Oh okay, this is how it works. This is how people do conflict. This is how people live together. This is how people play together to enforce the bonds. This is how people love on each other.” I start to get this nagging feeling that it’s time for us to continue on our road trip. I’ve gotta go. This was supposed to be a stop and I learned everything I needed to learn and now it’s time to move on to the next thing. I’m cleaning up my space. It’s like an Airbnb, so I’m taking the sheets off the bed and putting the towels and sheets on the washer. My mom is here in the background and I think she’s doing her part and will then meet me out by the car. I’m saying goodbye to the woman I know. I’m kind of dragging my feet. I have to change my clothes and I’m in the bathroom and I really want to shower but it’s time to go. I kind of half shower, half don’t, and I change my clothes. I’m kind of damp. I don’t really have a towel and part of my clothes get wet. I head out and say goodbye to everyone. I’m going through all these doors and they are the wrong doors to the outside. Well, they aren’t exactly the wrong doors. There was a direct route for me to get out to the car or there was this route through the living room and out through the kitchen into the sunroom, then garage, and then outside. It takes me a couple tries to get out of the house, but eventually I get out and we say goodbye. I get in the car and we continue on. It was light and bright in this dream - broad daytime - unlike other dreams this past week.",Dreamer 8,Rose,BLM,2/8/2020
77,,17/3/2020,"I’m in a house, it’s not my house and I don’t recognize it. It’s owned by a single person - a shorter man who might be a leprechaun or an elf, very eccentric. I’m staying in this house with him, but I’m not sure why. He has other people in the house with him and it’s like he collects orphans and I’m one of the orphans he’s collected. I’m in one of the bedrooms sleeping, zonked out, kind of, but I can see people coming in and out of the bedroom to see me. There’s a cleaning lady that comes in at some point and cleans around me while I’m passed out in the bed. The little man is entertaining other people. It’s very interesting. I don’t know what happens. At some point, the man brings his friend over who is the same height as him. She’s a woman and has a bob cut, her hair is red and short. This little man has grey, shoulder length hair. They act out this skit together, kind of like a TikTok. They act out this skit that I watch. I’m observing all this and the way he treats people who are coming in and out of his house is a little strange and removed. Then the scene changes. I’m with my friend Josh. I'm seeing these gigantic redwood trees. There’s a road next to me on my left and the shoulder is so wide that it looks like a park. There are picnic tables and at one table, people are throwing a birthday party - I’m guessing, but not sure. They’re having a meal together. It’s warm out and reminds me of Hawaii, even though the trees are redwood, they sway like palm trees. I’m hearing the sound of the ocean. It’s a gathering of people coming together to celebrate. It feels nice and pleasant and celebratory. There’s affection with all the people. Cars are whizzing by because it’s still a road. A couple of feet down there is another picnic table and another group of people celebrating, so it’s like there are all these pods of celebrations happening. Then the dream switches. I’m showing Josh how to get to this one valley where there are waterfalls and pools of water. I’ve actually dreamt of this valley and these waterfalls and how to get to them years and years ago. In that dream I was with my ex-boyfriend and our friends from growing up in Hawaii. This was the place these other friends took me in my dream years ago. We are at Hapuna Beach - a beach I went to all the time. I’m taking Josh down to the end because you have to go to the very end. There are two ways to get to this place - either from the end of Hapuna Beach where you’re at the bottom of the valley and the bottom of the waterfalls and the bottom of all the pools and you have to climb up. It’s funny because the beach is sand and palm trees and the valley is lush lush lush green, so much water, and total rain forest; the river water and the water of the pools are cold from rain water. We get to the bottom and there are slippery rocks. I look up towards the waterfalls and pools and am like, “No, we can’t get to it from here. We’re going to have to go around.” We leave the bottom. I take Josh onto this narrow road - it doesn’t even have a line through the middle and it’s old with so many potholes and broken up like the roads in Hawaii from all the rain. It goes through this residential area with chickens, houses, ti leaf hedges, cute chain link fences, and laundry hanging out in the yards. The road switchbacks, so we’re walking up the road back and forth and I’m trying to find the entrance - the place my friends had shown me in the other dream. I really want Josh to see the pools and be in the water because there’s something about the waters in this valley that is so healing and cleansing and I want to get to them. We’re switchbacking up this road that reminds me a little of Waipio Valley. We never get to the falls. Josh actually disappears out of the dream and my ex shows up with his lawyer. I have a lawyer. The setting is still these streets, but now we’re heading towards this house. The first thing that happens is my lawyer is convincing me that we’re fine and we have everything we need and we’re going to win the trial. My ex’s lawyer is like, “No you’re not, not even close.” So my lawyer tries to talk to his lawyer and has this little belt on that is recording. My ex’s lawyer finds it and is like, “You can’t win with this. That’s cheating. You can’t record conversations with me. That’s illegal.” So, my lawyer is essentially disgraced. My ex’s boyfriend kicks him off the case. Then this other woman comes in who is supposed to be the replacement, but she’s funny and acting clownish. She’s talking really fast. Her and my lawyer and me and my ex all get into a van. She has one of those Volkswagen vans. She’s driving around and says, “We’ve gotta find someone who’s willing to take on your case.” It’s so weird because my ex and his lawyer are in the car with me and we’re all talking about the case together. But she’s like, “We need to find somebody who can beat them.” And my ex’s lawyer is like, “Yup, you need to find someone who can beat me.” I’m like, “What?!” So she drives us around a little bit and she stops at this one house. First she paints her face to make it look like she’s been beat up and puts a big hat on and says, “Okay, I’m going to go into this house and we’re going to try to convince this person to be your lawyer.” She goes and knocks on the door and there’s nobody there. So she put on all this makeup to make her look like she has black eyes for no reason I can tell. She gets back in the van and we go further down this twisting road. She’s like, “Okay, we’re going to stop at this guy’s house. He knows what’s going on.” But she’s not paying attention and she drives into a pond in his front yard. I’m like, “Oh my god!” There are snapping turtles in the pond and komodo dragons in the pond and these little fish that look like horses.” I’m tripping out because all the different animals in this pond are intense because the dragons will eat you, and the turtles will snap at you, and the fish are clearly very rare. She just drove into the pond. I’m like, “Wait, this is not a very good first impression.” She reverses out of the pond and the water starts to drain. She’s like, “Well, we need to talk with this guy.” We all get out. My ex’s lawyer who is an older looking man with grey hair and really tan skin, kind of round in the body, gets out and goes to talk to the guy in the house. He’s saying, “This guy in the house is a genius. If anyone can beat me, it’s him. He needs to be the one to represent you.” I’m like, “Okay, sounds good.” He goes in the house and somehow convinces the guy. The first thing the guy notices is that his pond has drained and he’s really upset. I’m like, “Oh no, this woman who drove the van into the pond screwed it up.” But he agrees to talk with the lawyer. I can see this guy’s kids in the window and am like, “Hey kids! I know you can do this. If you come over here and turn on this one faucet and you press this one switch, the water will come back into the pond.” At this point, the pond is nothing but mud and everything is dying. It’s like we have seconds before everything is just dead. But I convince one of his kids to come out and I show them how to turn on the water and flip the controls. Somehow whatever was broken is unbroken and the pond starts to fill. I’m watching the water fill all the way to the top. There’s total relief because now this guy’s pond is not broken and he’s more likely to be my lawyer. My ex’s lawyer and this guy come out of the house and come talk to me and he’s like, “Yep, I’ll take your case and we’ll definitely win.” My ex and his lawyer are like, “Great, we were trying to orchestrate this the whole time.”",Dreamer 8,Rose,BLM,5/8/2020
78,,18/3/2020,"I am with my parents and we’re in a town that we’re visiting. My brothers are there, too, but not my sister. Events are happening in the town. We’re walking through the town with our tokens so we can take part in the events. I’m with my dad and we’re looking at a flyer that says something like: a couple tokens to do this talk with Mexican-Americans to hear their side of the story and get anti-racism training. My dad pays the money, but nothing happens and no one shows up. It’s a little mind boggling. We continue on and go see some other events. At one point, we’re in a car traveling and I’m the driver. I don’t know if I should be driving because I feel under the influence of something, not alcohol. I’ve got some friends in the back and maybe a sibling or two. At one part I drive over a bridge. The bridge is made of wood and it’s really, really high. I think there is water beneath the bridge. As I’m driving over it I think I should not be driving and I’m not safe to drive. We get over the bridge and I’m sweating because it’s freaking me out. We get to a downtown area where the buildings are close, the streets are narrow, and there are a lot of pedestrians. I’m very anxious to get the car parked back at the house becuase I’m scared I’m going to kill someone or everyone in the car. I still don’t know what I’m on or why I have this anxiety around driving. Eventually we do get back to the house. I get out of the car. A bunch of people go inside. I go inside for a second. The house is interesting - it’s a very Victorian era looking house on the outside and inside. It’s got a lot of space - the ceilings are tall, which kind of contradicts the Victorian era architecture because the houses are usually kind of small on the inside. I’m inside for a little bit. I go to the backyard and the area where the Mexican-American anti-racism talk was supposed to happen is actually happening in the backyard. The landscape changes from town to lush woodland. The sign or billboard that announced the event is in the middle of the backyard. A tree is growing in the corner. I go hang out by this tree. The tree is actually a Mexican-American woman. I think she is Mexican-American, but she could be from some other part of South America, I’m not entirely sure, I just know she’s Latina. She has been in this tree the whole time. She comes out of the tree and we are dialoguing. She is scolding me for not doing what I was supposed to do in terms of my anti-racism work. But it’s more than that! As she becomes more human and less tree, the place where she was standing in the corner of the yard starts to fill with water. There’s a rocky waterfall in this back corner, too. I’m lying down on a mattress. I was trying to lie down under this tree while in conversation with this woman because there is something she’s supposed to be teaching me that I’m supposed to be learning. But where her roots were, the water keeps filling. At first it’s just a little trickle, and I scooch to the side to get out of the way. Then there’s more. The air mattress I was lying on starts to get soaked and I pull it out of the way. She is also trying to get out of the way. Then suddenly in this back corner of the yard that had nothing but this dry old tree woman is suddenly luscious and completely verdant. There are plants and ferns growing everywhere and there’s a spring where she was. The water is the sweetest water you’ve ever tasted; it’s so clear and refreshing. Now it’s overflowing out of the pond and moving down because this back corner of the yard was on top of a hill. So the water starts to flow down and it’s touching everything that was really dry. Everything about the town was also really dry - there weren't a lot of green growing things. So the water is moving down this hill and the whole backyard and surrounding areas change from this dry almost desert place to this green luscious verdant place. The whole backyard becomes a sanctuary. The tree woman and I keep trying to move out of the water, which is somehow creating a bond between us. In the beginning it was really hard for us to talk to each other; I was on the defense and she was attacking. But as we are together trying to move out of the water, there is a softening where she is more willing to talk to me and I’m not as scared to listen to her and hear what she has to say. We become friends. It’s interesting the way we start to weave together. We’re still in the backyard and there are also parrots with us. One of the parrots is talking to me. Eventually the woman wants to go walk downtown and go for dinner. We walk out together to the town. The town is actually kind of dirty and gross. We ask some people for directions to a really good dinner place. This guy tries to give us directions, then says, “Never mind, I’m just going to take you.” So he does. We follow him to this dinner place.",Dreamer 8,Rose,BLM,14/8/2020
79,,19/3/2020,"Wild dreams! I’m hanging with my brother, the one born right after me. We go into a bar because he wants a drink, but I’m not drinking. We walk into this bar and it’s a two-story high bar and I can see a balcony where I can see the second story. It’s wood paneling, so the bar is dark and very masculine. There are deer heads on the wall and the tables are round and wooden. It kind of reminds me of a saloon, like a cliche Western. We walk up to the corner of the bar so my brother can order his drink. I turn around and see three guys who I haven't seen in a long time. One of the guys is a classmate of mine and also grew up on the same street as me. I haven’t seen him since we graduated. I'm like, “Oh my god! Hi! How are you?!” He’s really tall, taller than me and I’m 5’10” so he’s 6’4” or 6’5” so I’m definitely looking up at him. There’s also my friend Johnny who I grew up with in the same neighborhood, though we didn’t go to school together. I knew him the whole time growing up. There’s one other person, maybe Ikaika, another classmate who I’ve known since second grade. They come and stand behind me. They’re ordering drinks over my shoulder to the bartender. Initially I'm like, “Oh my gosh, hi, it’s so good to see you all!” Then they’re like, “Hey!” My former high school classmate starts asking me these condescending questions like: “How are you and what are you doing in your life? What have you accomplished?” I’m like, Whoa! This took a turn that I wasn’t expecting. They’re standing over me so I’m definitely feeling attacked and defensive. I don’t know if I get up on a chair or suddenly have super powers, so I can hover above them. But I get above them, the bartender and my brother and I’m like, “And what are you all doing with your life? Are you guys looking at your misogynistic beliefs and your sexist behaviors? What are you doing to undo the patriarchy and fight for social justice? How are you looking at your biases and your beliefs?” I’m asking specifically about their racial and gender biases and beliefs. I’m hovering over them as I say that. Then I just leave the bar because I’m disgusted with how they initially talked to me. I just didn’t want anything to do with them afterwards. As I was talking to them I could see they didn’t understand what I was talking about at all. They did not get the concept of biases or patriarchy or any of that. Complete scene change. Now I’m observing. There are a bunch of people who have been in a white van that you always see in the news. It’s like these forces are coming after the people in the van. The only three people I know for sure are the driver, Donny who does my taxes, Johnny with his wife Amanda who I've known since second grade and their kids. I’m also in the van, participating and observing. I have a sense of other people in the van. We’re trying to get somewhere and Donny is driving super crazy over snow, through woods, across rivers. There’s very little road driving happening in this first part. We are totally besieged. There are people or things not of this world that are coming after us and trying to kill us, literally trying to wipe us out. So we get to Johnny’s mansion. We are beat up. Some of us are dead. Not everyone in the van made it. The creatures that were going after us are still going after us. They gave us just long enough of a break to go inside the house and regroup to make a plan. We make our plan. I hear myself saying: “You have to keep the windows rolled up. You cannot stop for anything. You have to drive fast until we get to where we’re going.” I don’t know where our destination is. I don’t know why we’re running from these things, some of which do look human. I don’t know what our goal is. As we’re in the mansion, those creatures start to come in. I keep seeing black tar being spit out of their mouths and if the tar touches us, we die. So, we all run out of the house. We have a new white van because the old one got really beat up and just didn’t work anymore. So we all pile into this white van. I’m like, “Okay, everyone roll up the windows. Donny, go as fast as you can. Don’t stop for anyone or anything. Just keep going.” This is the part where we drive through multiple scenes or landscapes. At first we’re driving through a town. When we drive through town, there’s an Asian man who’s sitting next to me in the van and he cracks his window a little bit. I start yelling at him because I can see on the right side of the car a pair of twin women with dark hair, but their bodies don’t move like humans. You can tell they’re something else. One of them spits on the windshield. Donny wipes the spit off with the windshield wiper fluid. The spit is an orange color. I’m expecting it to melt through the window at any moment, but it doesn’t. When Donny uses the windshield wiper fluid and because the guys’ window is down, some of the fluid comes in through the window and hits his eyes. His eyes start to burn. I look at him and his eyes are the goldish yellow color of the spit. I’m like, “I told you to keep the window closed. Here’s another casualty that could have been avoided.” Donny slows down. These twin women start telling us, “Okay, if you’re going to survive this, you have to go.” I’m like, “Yeah, I know!” I’m trying to tell Donny to go. Now it’s raining and the pavement is wet. We see the road in front of us is blocked by some of these things or people that are trying to get us. Donny swerves off and he goes over a railroad track. I don’t know how the van makes it over the railroad track. He swerves around this big piece of metal in our path. Then he swerves around other people and other cars. We’re going through forests. We seem to be under attack this whole time. There are a couple children in the van with us. We’re really trying to keep those children safe. This is part of the whole mission, though I have no idea what the point of this mission is. It’s really wild and there’s a lot of pressure.",Dreamer 8,Rose,election,26/8/2020
80,,20/3/2020,"I walk into a room, like an acupuncturist's treatment room. I can see rice screens in the background. I’m there to see a healer. It looks like a cross between a Master Healer and an ex buddhist monk who I learned meditation from - he left the monastery because he preferred joy. I’m on the treatment table and facing him. He’s wearing a light blue robe or shirt. He starts to move his hands like an air bender. I start to fall asleep like the REM healing sleep and there are images coming to mind. I tell myself to remember these images so I can remember them later. Then I go into the deep healing sleep. He’s still doing the airbender motion in front of my body. I’m lying on my right side the whole time, almost in the fetal position. He’s working at chest level - heart and solar plexus energy centers. I have a sense that I’m asleep for a while. As I come out, my brain kicks in again and tells me to remember the healing images. As I wake up, the healer says: “Tend to your masculine energy child. Look up Libra moon. That’s what you need for healing.” I did a deep healing breath as he finished his hand motions - in both my sleep in my dream and my sleep in real life. I woke up in that position - lying on my right side. I had a sense he was removing an energetic entanglement.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,30/8/2020
81,,21/3/2020,"I am at the house of my friend/boss. I'm trying to find a place to put a piano so I can learn to play it. I’m having a hard time finding a wall to put it against or just a spot to have it. It needs a plug and I can’t find a plug. I’m brainstorming and talking out loud with myself and with her to try and get this piano put someplace. But it’s her house, so I have this feeling of reservation because I need to get her permission. It feels a bit awkward because I don’t think she needs the piano. She’s also my boss and I’m fucking around with this piano thing, but there is work I need to be doing, so that feels a bit odd. It’s also quarantine time like now, but more apocalyptic feeling. My attention moves on from the piano and the headlines are pretty dire with deaths and whatnot. I’m also reading the astrology and getting the astrology report - it was basically telling me to buckle up because there’s more tension and destruction coming. We’ve already had a lot, but there’s more based on the planetary alignments. For whatever reason, it’s time for me to leave the house. I head out and am walking down the side of the road. I don’t know if I have my mask on or if I’m carrying it with me. The skies are dark and ominous. There are cars going by and I’m trying to avoid them. It’s strange, it’s like I’m trying to avoid people all together. The road is paved, but either side of the road are grassy fields without a lot of buildings or anything. In the distance I can see a stand of trees, way far down the way. All of a sudden there's a group of younger people also on the side of the road. I’m trying to keep distance from them for whatever reason - I don’t know if it’s quarantine rules or what. I can hear what is going on. They’re all talking and being talked to by a scout leader or something. The scout leader is trying to prepare them for stuff. I’m trying to mind my own business and read the astrology and whatnot. They are teenagers, 16-18 years old. The scout leader is warning them: “Hey, pay attention. There are people out there who will kidnap you! We’re kind of living in this no-man’s land type of place with no rules. There are definitely people out to get you.” It sounded a lot like conspiracy theory stuff, but he was basically trying to warn these kids about a cartel of people who were kidnapping kids and doing trafficking but also trying to give them coronavirus. I was nodding my head with him and saying, “Yeah, watch out. This stuff is real. There are people out there who don’t have your best interest at heart and are running the world and have let this virus come out. You’ve gotta be careful because not everything is as it seems.” At this point cars are going by and I see old white people who look like they are on their way to church going by in their cars. Then, somehow the scene changes and I’m in a train station. It’s like all of a sudden I’m trying to get away from people. I see that some of these kids are on a train. It reminds me of the images I saw growing up from the Holocaust with people packed onto the trains. It’s kind of like what I’m living in the dream. There are “bad guys” who are putting us on the train and trying to scare us and poke at us. I’m watching all of this and realize it’s time for me to go. I gather up my mat that I was sitting on, my newspaper and my mask. I am watching this shady stuff go down. I start to walk away hoping no one notices me so I can walk back to my friend’s house. I do manage to sneak off and they don’t stop me.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,31/8/2020
82,,22/3/2020,"I’m at a huge event in a huge stadium. I don’t think it’s a sporting event, though. All kinds of people are there - all races, all colors, all genders and non-genders - the whole human family. I’m not sure what we’re watching or participating in - not sure if it’s a show or convention or speeches or sporting event. But something is happening down in the center of the arena. I’m sitting way back and at the top. I’m not sitting by anyone I know - there isn’t anyone I know in this dream. To my left is a bunch of white young women laughing and being obnoxious. To my right two rows down is a black family - I see a woman and a man. I fall asleep at some point. I wake up suddenly because there is a lot of noise and it has gotten loud in my section. I startle awake. I’m trying to figure out what's going on. The black woman two rows in front of me is talking about the white women that had been over to my left. Apparently they said something totally racist and obnoxious, but I missed it because I had been asleep. She’s talking to the other white people in the crowd: “When are y’all going to say something?!” She’s mad; she’s pissed. I’m trying to catch up on what’s happened and hear what she’s saying, but my brain is foggy and muggy. I missed the whole event and my window to say something to those other white women who were being rude. All I can feel is the pain of all the balck people around me of being treated as not human. It’s making me mad. I’m really upset and I’m also really conscious that my anger and sadness for them is not really appropriate to express because I fell asleep and I don’t know what’s really going on, and I’m white and they see me as the enemy. This is making me want to cry to know that my empathy and compassion would be rejected. I also feel anger at the white women that seemed so ignorant and uncaring in their ways. There’s a shift in the dream. Now this event suddenly makes sense. This is a showcase of cultures. There was black culture in the hundred million thousand ways they have. Then it’s Hawaii’s turn to showcase what they know. I’ve now moved positions in this huge arena and I’m a lot further down and a lot closer to the stage. I’m with the Hawaiian contingency because I’m from there, but I’m not Hawaiian, so I’m not really doing anything. There are rows that I’m not allowed to sit in because I’m not Hawaiian. So I go up a few rows and see all my classmates in a row - some are Hawaiian but most are not. I see Johnny and his wife Amanda. Johnny is white like I am. Amanda is white and Filipino. He’s funding it. He has a big chain around his neck like a king would wear to denote kingship. So he’s in charge. I’m uncomfortable with that because he’s a white guy and this is the Hawaiian contingent. I’m wondering why a Hawaiian isn’t in charge. I’m also crazy jealous because whatever this guy touches is gold and he makes tons of money and he somehow has figured out the secret to being kind and not being an asshole, yet still do business and make money. I’m like, “Wow, I haven’t figured that out.” I know how to be kind, but I don’t know how to make money. This is interesting to feel. So the Hawaii contingent goes down and they do their cultural piece. Some of my friends who are not Hawaiian are somehow allowed to be down on the floor doing their thing. I get the feeling of not being allowed to be in there and that really hurts the not-belonging especially because now it doesn’t seem to be based on skin color. As I’m watching this happen, I’m sitting with Johnny and Amanda and some other friends, and cheering so hard for Hawaii. It’s a beautiful display that the whole world gets to see. Then suddenly it’s time to eat. I’m starving and everybody’s starving. Somebody says, “El Sancho is serving!” I’m like, “Yes! I want to eat food from El Sancho!” Actually I only want to eat pulled pork. Johnny jumps up and goes. I see Amanda go. I’m like, “Oh my god, am I invited? Do I get to eat?” I’m not invited but I’m hungry. Then the dream shifts again. I remember being in this barren desert place. I can see mountains in the distance and dead trees. I’m not alone. I can't tell who I’m with; it’s a female body or entity who also seems lost. Maybe I’m trying to get us someplace. She’s just wandering. I don’t think she’s a human - the energy doesn’t seem human. We’re wandering in circles looking for something because there’s something we need to find. I say, “We need to follow the sun.” We face the sun. The sun is orange like the moon is sometimes as it rises from smoke and fire. The sun is rising or setting - I can’t tell - behind this huge mountain range. We’re heading in that direction. As we’re walking through the sand, there are all these glass bookshelves, some toppled in the sand and some standing up. I look into one and there are two books on one of the shelves. I think one is a dictionary or computer programming. The book next to it seems to be literature. I’m looking at these two books on this glass shelf. I can feel the warmth of the sunlight and it has an orange tinge. It seems like we're heading in the direction now that we’re heading towards the mountains, but I’m still not sure what we’re supposed to be doing, or where we’re going, or why we’re in the desert in the first place.",Dreamer 8,Rose,BLM,2/9/2020
83,,23/3/2020,"I am walking through an outdoor market. There are shops, too. I am with friends - we met up at a cafe. The cafe is owned by a friend, a woman, though not somebody I recognize in waking life. I am sort of wandering and stopping to talk with people. I walk through the cafe because I’m meeting people there. Then I go to leave the cafe and get my shoes. I walk through this door and bend down to grab my slippers. There are four pairs of slippers. One of my friends who I’m there to meet - this friend is switching between my friend Beth and a classmate from high school - her face keeps changing. As I bend down to pick up my slippers, she slams the door open onto my head. I don’t know if she did it on purpose or not. My reaction is that she did it on purpose, because I stand up and slam the door back on her. I’m pissed that she has hurt me like this because it was so unexpected and triggered my trauma response which is, “if you hit me, I’m going to hit you back harder.” I do it. Then I’m like, “Oh god!” I still can’t tell whether she did it on purpose or not because she’s very shocked that I slammed the door back on her. But she also has a malicious look in her eye like she got me to do what she wanted me to do, which was to hurt her. Then she goes and tells everyone that I just slammed the door on her. I’m feeling all kinds of shame about it. I walk back into the cafe with the owner who is my friend in the dream realm. I’m trying to explain myself, but I can just feel that I should not have slammed the door on her and hurt her like that. Any words coming out of my mouth sound like a terrible excuse. The cafe itself is very bright and airy. There is a lot of white, lots of big windows. Everyone is hustling and bustling and all the servers are pretty quick. You can hear the clink of glasses and china. There are pastries coming out and coffee being served. So the space itself is pretty bright, but me coming in to say I just did this thing feels very shadowy in comparison. Then the dream switches. I’m with Jamie, another pole dancer instructor and her students. We are all trying to do some pole, but there’s no pole. We order a pole online and it arrives. I go to set it up and it’s way too skinny - it looks like a coat rack. I’m trying to put it together but there are all these hooks coming out of it and I’m thinking there’s no way anyone could pole on this thing, plus it’s too skinny and it’s too short! It’s about my height, so it wouldn’t even work as a free-standing pole. I walk into the studio and say, “Jamie, here’s the pole, I don’t know if it is going to work!” She’s like, “Don’t worry about it, I got it!” I look and see three regular poles at the far end of the studio for everyone to use. I’m excited because now I can actually pole. There are only three of them, but I figure we can all take turns. I leave that pole on the side and stop fussing with it. Then the dream transitions. I leave the pole studio and go to the beach. I’m with some people who I don’t know or who are acquaintances. I’m with Josh and a little one - I think it’s his little one that he’s watching. I’m talking to these other people I’m at the beach with. It’s a woman and a little girl. I think she is the little girl’s mother. The little girl is in the back of a pickup truck parked under an easy-up, so there’s shade. I look at the little girl and she has a swimsuit on and is wrapped in a towel. Her skin is really red. I see that she has a really bad sunburn. The mom is wanting to take her back into the ocean, but I tell her not to take her out of the shade because she has a really bad sunburn. The mom unwraps the towel and starts to pull the girl’s swimsuit off. The girl is maybe 6 or 7. Her unburnt skin is the palest white with freckles. Her burnt skin is like third degree burns. I’m horrified and looking at the mother like, “Did you not put sunscreen on her or anything? You have to take her to the hospital, that’s how burnt she is.” I’m horrified by it and trying to see if I have anything to put on this child’s skin but I don’t. The mother does take her to the hospital. Then I turn and look towards the ocean and Josh is running with his little one down the beach. They are having a good time. But I’m trying to see if there is sunscreen on both of them. I’m really worried that everyone is going to be burnt. Then the dream shifts again. I’m trying to find a home that’s not in America. I’m looking at different landscapes and it’s like I can teleport myself to these different landscapes and get a feel of them. One looks very much like pictures I’ve seen of Switzerland. We go through a desert, too. I think Josh is with me. I end up at this table in a home and Helen is there. It’s Helen’s class of priestesses, or whatever it is she’s teaching now. I’m like, “Oh my god, I haven’t seen you in forever. What are you doing in my dream? Where are we?” It’s a long table and there are a bunch of people, though not all female bodied priestesses. Josh is with me and I’m like, “Josh, you need to listen to what she says but listen really critically.” I know that I’m telling myself this, too. I’m following along with everything she's saying, though I’m not having a conversation because she is talking and teaching. While she’s talking, I’m listening and thinking, “Wow, she is still in denial about the sickness of whiteness and colonialism and patriarchy and privilege. She is spiritually bypassing still and setting her up as a guru.” These are my lucid thoughts as I listen to her talk. In the dream, her speech was very particular and I cannot remember it which is a bummer because I sense there was some information I really needed. Eventually we are at dinner and Josh and I leave the dinner. I’m like, “No this is not the place for me either. I just need to leave.”",Dreamer 8,Rose,BLM,27/9/2020
84,,24/3/2020,"I’m with a bunch of people I don’t know. We’re younger, maybe early twenties. We’re gathered from all parts of the globe. It is in the time of coronavirus because everyone has to wear masks. There are people I recognize - a guy I used to work with from the grocery store and a few others. We are all getting some kind of training. There’s a woman who puts off some sketchy evil vibes. She is talking with us. We are doing some sort of evaluation but also trained or taught about how to use our superpowers. She’s like, “For all of us to do what we need to do, there are certain boundaries or lines that will be crossed.” I’m thinking, “I don’t think I signed up to be a bad guy.” I’m listening to her talk. She has a little pet animal in her lap. We’re all sitting at a long, tired dining room table. She’s down below me and there’s maybe eight or twelve students on either side of her down below. I’m on the other side of the table which is higher than hers. I’m looking down and watching. There are maybe only four or five of us on this side of the table. This little pet in her lap looks like Stitch from “Lilo and Stitch.” She’s talking to it and petting it while she’s talking to us. I get the sense that it has special powers and it is evaluating us and telling her in her ear which one of us will be good candidates for something. I watch her get up and walk around the table with it. It tells her specific things. It points at an Arab student next to me and shakes its head no. She looks at him and tells him to leave because I guess he doesn’t have the power that he needs to have to do the things she wants us to do. So he grabs his extra masks. He had tried to hand me a mask earlier like I didn’t have one, but I said, “Thanks for the extra one, but I am actually wearing one right now.” He leaves. She holds the animal near me. In my head or somebody drops this knowledge that the animal tells her we each can have an animal and it corresponds to an emotional superpower. I suddenly understand that this meeting was about who was going to end up with one of those animals, like what she has. She moves on. I stand up and follow her into the kitchen. She’s moving as if she’s very busy and has to move onto the next task. The kitchen is also an office and there’s a huge fish tank. She is already giving instructions to someone else. I come up to her and say, “There’s one of those things that you guys can create for me.” She stops talking and has a grin on her face and is like, “Well actually, you my dear, have enough power for three of these.” I’m a little taken aback and surprised. This woman has dark hair and reminds me a little bit of Helen but she’s not. They correlate to emotional superpowers, one is my ability to laugh and smile - at some point this thing smiled at me with all its sharp pointy teeth. She says, “Yes, and you have two others.” There's something about shadow and something about fighting, warrior spirit. We all pile into cars and drive somewhere. I’m with my friend from the grocery store. We drive to a large gathering for all of us.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,28/9/2020
85,,25/3/2020,"My dream was like a full on sci-fi movie starring Ryan Renolds. It starts out with us in outer space and there are aliens who are trying to bomb the earth or blow up the entire universe. The drama is high. Everyone is in panic and fight or flight mode. I think I’m on a ship. We’re trying to figure out how to stop the aliens. Ryan Renolds is trying to come up with a plan. There are a ton of people and I don’t know any of them. They are the movie extras. I don’t think I see the aliens, I just see their ships through a spaceship window. The plan includes getting ahold of these two units that will blow something up - very typical movie bullshit. I’m on the ship. There are a couple ships in the fleet. All of the ships fly at superspeed. They’re flying through the planets in our solar system, so we’re whizzing by Mars and Venus, then you see Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune. I think the goal is to get to Jupiter or Saturn and blow up one of them. So, this is the scene. Then just like in the movies, the movie cuts away to Earth because we’re all trying to save Earth. The sky on Earth is a blood red - it looks like how the sky looked when all the smoke was around. I’m on the street suddenly and Ryan Renolds is with me. I don’t know if I’m actually interacting with him or not. It’s almost like I’m silently following him at first. I guess I’m the girlfriend character in the movie and he’s talking with me. We’re on the streets of Earth and I look up and see the sky is red. I keep seeing all these white parachutes falling - it’s the people who were on the spaceships. They’re coming home so they can say goodbye to their loved ones. They’re all ejecting out of space and coming down to Earth for one last goodbye to all the people they love. In the meantime, Ryan is still trying to figure out how to stop the aliens. They’re trying to find the hole in their plans or where their weak spot is. There’s a scene with the parachutes falling and I’m listening to him talk and figure something out. Then the scene cuts away to what looks like Mission Control. There’s a woman reading a screen monitor. At one point, I remember seeing Ryan type into this computer: “Happy Birthday!” When he does that, all the aliens who were of one hive mind, suddenly say, “It’s my birthday, it’s my birthday! Happy birthday to me! No, it’s my birthday!” And this is just filling up the screen with all the aliens all talking to each other. Also, this woman at Mission Control whose computer this is realizes that all of the aliens look like humans and have been on Earth this whole time and now all of a sudden they’re fragmenting out into individuals because Ryan typed this one thing into the computer. She’s sitting back and laughing because she’s unlocked the key of whatever it is we need to know about them. Then, the scene goes back to me and Ryan. Now a lot of time has passed since he typed “Happy Birthday” into the computer. He and I are running through the streets of a city. The people speak English. Somebody is trying to catch him. I can’t tell if it’s these aliens disguised as humans or humans helping aliens or humans who are idiots. But there’s a cop looking person. The uniform is slightly different than a cop uniform. It’s almost like they have different rights as a cop - more rights. They are trying to catch Ryan. I’m a little further away from him now. I’m not sure why. The cop starts to beat him up with a billy club. There’s a bunch of other people with the cop who are also trying to beat him up. I’m pissed off. He’s fighting back. I run over there. They dropped him. He’s immobilized. They start to wrap him in a plastic sheet with a couple layers and then a blanket. I get to them and start swinging enough to clear the space. They back up away from me. I unwrap Ryan and his left shoulder is totally dislocated and looks terrible. I pop it back in for him. Then I pull him. We start to head off. I’m threatening these people the whole time like, “Fuck off. I will fuck you up.” The funny thing is when I was throwing the punches, it was very very unskilled and I couldn’t have hurt anybody, yet they backed away. So it’s kind of like they were just letting me do it. The lucid part of my mind is like, “You can’t fight for shit! You need to learn how to fight!” I go back into the dream and Ryan and I start running. The cop is yelling some bullshit at us as we go and I’m ignoring it, but part of me is wondering why they are letting us go because I wasn’t such a good fighter. And why did they just rough Ryan up and then let us run off? It doesn’t make any sense. Then Ryan realizes there’s one other thing he needs to do to help things. I don’t think a lot was accomplished. I still think Earth was going to be blown up or something.",Dreamer 8,Rose,environment,1/10/2020
86,,26/3/2020,"I’m at a house with a bunch of people. It’s kind of like an Airbnb we’ve rented. I don’t recognize all the people. I’m uncomfortable, for sure. I don't know what we’re doing in the house. There’s something we’re supposed to be doing as a group. I end up leaving the house. I go somewhere else. The house is in a city. I don’t know where I go, but I find myself trying to make my way back to the house but then driving a car. My dad is in the car and we’re going into the city through the backway to avoid the traffic and major roads. He’s in the passenger seat and asking me if I know where I’m going. I’m like, “Yeah dad, thanks, just be quiet and follow along. Don’t worry, we’ll make it to our conference.” But the GPS navigates me back to the house I had been at. This house had a lot next door to it with a rundown house and a bunch of land that was run down. When we get back, the house next door that was run down now is occupied by a cute lesbian couple. They’re bakers. They’ve fixed up the house. The gardens are all fixed up. They have right down the road an off the charts bakery that’s super fantastic. So we get there and my dad’s like, “This isn’t where we’re supposed to be.” I’m like, “Yeah, I know. But the upside of this is this bakery is available to us and we need to stop and get water anyway.” So we go into the bakery. The floors are wood. There’s a section with the bakery case. It’s packed! There are so many people - tourists from all over the place and locals. I go in and we walk up to the counter. I say, “I hear you guys are famous. Do you have grain-free and dairy-free desserts? I can’t eat those other things.” They’re like, “In fact, we do.” So they take me down to the far end of the case and show me the items that I can have. I’m so excited about it. My dad’s excited about it, too. We order the items we can order. But it takes a while for them to get them to us because there are so many people who have ordered and there are so many people in front of us. We wander off from the area to grab a water out of these coolers. There are drink coolers that seem out of place because the bakery is super cute, like a French bakery feel, but off in the corner with tables for eating is a Coca Cola drink cooler. It looks so out of place! I grab a water but am like, “Eh, what are these doing here?” The tables are super close together. I’m trying to get through the tables and keep running into people. In my mind I’m like, “This is not coronavirus six feet.” But no one is wearing masks and everyone is close. As I go through, there’s a table with an Asian woman sitting, and there’s a black man sitting at a table next to it. I’m trying to go in between them, but I’m rubbing legs with both of them to get to the drink cooler. The Asian woman gives me a dirty look. The black man is like, “Oh, I’m sorry, I’ll get out of the way,” but he’s giving me this mischievous grin and there’s a twinkle in his eye because we’re touching. I grin at both of them and just say “excuse me,” and go to the drink cooler and get a water for me and a soda for my dad. I go back through the big group. It’s still super crowded. I go back to the case where they’re handing out the desserts. I get there and am like, “Hey do you have my dessert?” They’re like, “We called you and you didn’t come. It’s taken us a while, but we have it.” I’m kind of getting scolded, but they give it to me anyway. It doesn’t look as pretty as it would have because it’s been sitting for a little bit. I’m a little disappointed, but I take it anyway. I’m like, “For sure, for sure, this is dairy-free and grain-free?” They’re like, “Yep.” I’m looking at it and am like, “That’s full of dairy if I’ve ever seen a dessert full of dairy.” But I take it anyway. I’m going to head out and eat it. Then I sort of wake up because in real life the wind blows so hard it rattles the trees at my window. It’s very startling, but I fall back to sleep and dream some more. But that’s all I can remember.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,12/10/2020
87,,27/3/2020,"I am with a fellow priestess/witch, but I don’t recognize her from this lifetime. I am apprenticing under her. I’ve already done my apprenticeship actually and now I’m coming to learn what she does at her station. She’s in this small tourist town with all four seasons, and it’s Fall now. I’m not exactly sure what she’s there for, but she’s showing me how she does the Work. There are some things I need to know about the job specifically. I’m not sure if she’s there for protection or what. We’re in a house, like an old cabin with walls made of wood. I’m watching what she’s doing. She has this rolling cart that’s got two tiers and a bunch of stuff on it. She’s showing me how to charge up some things. I’m looking out the window and there’s water everywhere, so I think we’re on a lake or something. The town is behind us. I’m watching her hands move. I’m watching each of the steps she’s taking. I go to put my hands near the cart with artifacts. Everything feels really strong. I can feel the energy coming off. She keeps asking things like, “Can you feel that? We’re adding extra protection.” I’m like, “Of course I can feel that. Everything is really strong. This is what I’m trained for.” At one point she interrupts herself and apologizes. She says, “These are my neuroses and I worry about these things. This is what I worry about, but I think you’ll be fine.” I’m like, “Yes, I will be fine. I’ve had the training. I’m strong. I can feel the energy coming off. I can direct and mold and shape it as you’re doing. This is something I know how to do.” Then I maybe leave her to go run an errand or something. The scene changes and I’m outside the house. I’m walking through the town on the streets. I know a car accident is going to happen and then I witness it but keep going because I know the people can handle whatever is happening because it’s not a bad one, it’s just a fender bender t-bone, but everyone was going less than 25mph. Everyone is okay, they just have to get everyone’s insurance information. I continue to this open air marketplace. There are all kinds of items that you would find at a fair trade shop. I think I’m getting an ingredient we need for the cart and the spells we’re casting. I’m vibrating and radiating so much power, and I’m watching who’s starting to follow me. While I think everyone in this marketplace is human, some of the people are wearing helmets with horns, and someone looks like a totem - the totem is gold and I can’t tell whether it’s a hat they’re wearing or if they just are the totem with the different animals stacked on top of each other. So I’m just noticing who’s following me, who’s attracted to my energy and who’s not. Some of the people following me do have what feels like somewhat ill-intent but I know I’m untouchable so I’m not so worried about it. Some of the people following me don’t even know why they’re attracted to my energy, they just are, and they’re harmless. I’m going on my way even though I see all the people who are attracted to me or who are tracking me. Some of them are magic-makers themselves and they can do magic but they’re just watching. I find the item I’m supposed to find. I’m still watching who’s coming in and out of this market, noting who the non-magical beings are. I walk by this booth where they’re closing up shop because it’s twilight and the open air market is closed. One of the people closing up shop is Janaya Future Kahn and they are someone I know from instagram who identifies as “they.’ They are beautiful and on instagram they do social justice work. The way they talk is so amazing, always coming from love. Even in my dream as I’m walking past them in their booth and they’re folding things up for the evening, they’re talking about love and getting things to people in need. I slow down long enough to watch them fold up one of their items and to listen to them talk. I’m so smitten because this person is such a caring, warm, loving person but also very fiery and passionate about what they’re doing. I know I’m to return back to my post, which is this house on the edge of the lake. As I’m walking back I see piers with sailboats and this house juts out over the water. It’s important that we’re over the water and that the water is under us in parts of our work. I’m watching the sun go down and it’s almost dark but the sky is all these beautiful colors. I know that I have all the skills I need for the task at hand. In fact, I’m overflowing with the amount of energy. I do think it’s interesting that when I walked by Janaya Future Kahn, they didn’t look up and see me; they were so focused on what they were doing that out of all the people in the marketplace who could feel me, they didn’t look up and see me at all. I thought it was so interesting that they were so engrossed in what they were doing and the conversation they were having with other people that they never even looked up.",Dreamer 8,Rose,BLM,14/10/2020
88,,28/3/2020,"I’m with the kids and I’m in a city I don’t recognize at all. I think it’s supposed to be Seattle because there’s ocean and hills. It’s definitely a city. My ex shows up and his parents show up. I get this feeling of, “Oh my god, get the fuck away from me.” His dad is the most prominent person in the dream. He’s scolding me like I’ve done something wrong and I need to go with them somewhere. We get in the car - I don’t know if it’s my car or their car, but it’s a stick shift. I’m driving it backwards, like I’m in reverse the whole time. I’m having a fucking hard time staying on the road the GPS is telling me to go on. I keep driving onto the wrong road. At one point I get in a parking lot and I go around the parking lot three times. His dad is being condescending and telling me I’m going the wrong way. But I’m driving the way he wanted me to drive or the way he was showing me to drive and that’s why I’m having such a hard time. Finally after three or four attempts of trying to get on the right road to get where we were supposed to be going, I’m like, “Fuck it.” I stand up and turn around and sit in the car facing the way I’m used to driving it. Then we start heading towards their hotel room in the city. The kids and I were closer to the beach on the outskirts, but now we’re heading into the city. I don’t want to be with my ex, his dad or his mom. I don’t want to be in this car. I don’t want to be in this city. All of this is so wrong. Now I’m driving facing the right way and I’m following the GPS but it’s taking me weird places. I’ve never driven in this area before. We go through residential areas and I drive on the wrong road but we make it through. Then at some point I’m like “Fuck it, I’m not going to take this car because it’s going wrong places.” Now the GPS is saying, “Okay get out of the car and now you have to go on foot through all these places.” It’s still coronavirus times and there are all these weird things we have to do. Everyone else is wearing a mask but I’m not. At one point we are walking through a block party. I’m in the lead, but I can feel them behind me and the pressure to get it right and perfect is so intense. I’m getting frustrated because I don’t want to be there and I don’t want them to tell me what to do and I don’t want them to follow me and I don’t want to go to their hotel room deep in the middle of the city because they’re going to lecture me about some shit that’s not mine to do. I feel so much frustration. I’m taking a wandering meandering path. I walk through this block party and through somebody’s house. It’s a college kids party. I’m watching all the young college kids and can remember when I used to be like that and do that kind of shit and just be drunk as fuck. None of them are social distancing and I’m not either way. I walk through the house. I’m watching college girls in short skirts flirt. I don’t know if I see any guys at the party. I walk out the front yard and through another neighborhood. I’m walking down one road, but my ex’s dad is pointing up to one road that’s parallel to us - it’s like a freeway and there’s a chain link fence between that one and the one I’m on. He’s pointing up to that one like I’m supposed to be up on the freeway. I’m like, “Oh fuck no, I’m not walking up there.” I just keep going. They’re following me somewhat reluctantly. At some point, our paths do diverge and they go off somewhere. They end up in front of me and I start following them. Now we’re walking through a designated green area and park in the inner city. There are all these trees. We’re downtown on a street with four lanes. We hit a stoplight. We’re walking. There are black people lined up on either side of this road, sitting on a bench that seems to go on forever. In the background is a park with trees. I’m just walking through and wondering if this is a safe place for us to be walking through because we’re a bunch of white people and they’re a bunch of black people. My ex father in law and mother in law are not the most savvy about anti-racism. I’m hoping they won’t talk. We walk through this area and get to this place where there is scaffolding on the sidewalk that they've put up to work on the buildings above the sidewalk. The scaffolding is really narrow and tight. There’s a man helping us get through it because at some point you have to crawl up and then shimmy your way through a tiny opening that’s all scaffolding. I can see through it but it's metal bars and tiny so a person bigger than me could not fit through. He looks sketchy with long greasy hair in a mullet. He looks like the character from Schitt's Creek that looks like a redneck. He’s helping me through this tight squeeze, then I see him help the others. I don’t know where the kids are. So I go through this scaffolding maze and we come out the other side. We reach the hotel they’re staying at. It’s a hotel that they used to live at but moved away from. They’re just staying at it now because they had to come get me and my ex so they could tell us off about something, I don’t know what. We go into the hotel. We go up to the floor they used to be on. The hotel is a bit shabby and I'm surprised that they used to live there. They take us up to this floor and the Golden Girls live on this floor with them along with some other people. It’s hilarious. The Golden Girls and some other people are out in the hallway where there are couches for gathering. The Golden Girls are talking and laughing with each other. They’ve just had dinner and there are plates, dishes and cooking knives everywhere. My ex father in law shoos everybody home and says, “It’s late. It’s time for everybody to go home. None of you are wearing masks. Go on.” I’m like, “Oh no, here it comes.” I see the Golden Girls leave and go to their rooms. I think they’re flirting with a bunch of older men who are residents here, too. They all go back to their rooms. I see my ex father in law pick up a huge chef’s knife and he starts to clean it and put it back. He’s like, “They always leave their stuff out.” He says it kind of fondly but also with exasperation. My ex mother in law has been making comments with him this whole time, but I’ve been ignoring them most of the time. I’m still wondering why I’m here and why I’m with these people of all people. What do they want? What does my ex want? My ex hasn’t been saying much this whole time. But all three of them are giving me this vibe like: “You are fucking everything up. You are doing everything wrong. Now we need to get you and scold you and show you how it’s really done. And these are all the things you owe us.” I want out. The only time I had any control was when I was wandering through the block party and along the street with the black people - I knew I would be fine because I wouldn’t say something stupid. But now that we’re in this old hotel where we used to live and my ex father in law is cleaning this knife, I’m waiting for them to tell me what they’re needing to tell me. But that never happens and I don’t know what they’re wanting to say.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,16/10/2020
89,,29/3/2020,"I’m dreaming that I was over a river, maybe standing on a bridge, and watching children and their teacher swim across. They were working on some kind of project and swimming back and forth across the river. The big part of the dream that stands out is that I was holding a baby and it was someone else’s baby. They handed the baby to me and said, “Feed it.” I looked at them confused because it wasn’t my baby and I had no milk to feed it. Whoever handed it to me, the baby’s mother, did something to me so my breasts were lactating. I remember my breasts hurting. I could feel the feeling of let-down but also the soreness of when you’ve just started breastfeeding or your baby has nursed a little too hard and your nipples are sensitive. I could feel that and the pressure of being engorged. I couldn’t feed the baby fast enough. I kept trying. The baby had a plastic face shield that everyone is wearing these days and it couldn’t get to the milk. I tried to lift the face shield up so it could latch on, but the baby just couldn’t get latched on in the right way. I remember feeling frustrated but also scared for the baby because I couldn’t feed it and wasn’t able to give it what it needed. I also remember the pain of being engorged and not being able to nurse.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,26/10/2020
90,,30/3/2020,"I am talking to a detective who I’m hiring to go watch my ex-father-in-law and my dad who are supposed to be taking turns watching my son who is an infant. They’re both retired, they don't have jobs, they don’t work. The reason I’m hiring this detective is because I don’t think they’re watching my son very well and I don’t think it’s entirely safe. They’re watching him for me because I’m working and I don’t have time to watch him and I need them to watch him for me while I work to make money. They’re in a pool on vacation or at the place they live. It’s odd that they’re together because they don’t really know each other in real life. The detective watches them and sort of gets involved and is telling them how they’re not doing a good job watching my son. My son is about two or three in this dream. Both of them, my dad and ex-father-in-law, are taken aback at being lectured by this man who’s telling them how to do their job. Neither of them can figure out who has hired this detective. They each think the other has hired him, so they’re trying to point fingers at each other about it. I’m observing this whole thing. I’m on the pool deck somewhere but they don’t see me. I show myself to them to check in on my son. They’re both trying to convince me as to why the other one is not doing a good job. I eventually say, “No, I’m the one who hired the detective to show me that you guys are not doing good. The reason I hired him is because the two of you are neglecting my son a bit and you’re both talking shit about me and the fact that I’m not around to watch my son and it’s because I have to work because no one else is supporting me and you two old white guys have a whole ton of privilege and never had to stay home to watch the kids and don’t know what it’s like to be a single mom and have no idea how hard it is. All I’m asking for is a little bit of help and you two can’t even give me that. I hired a detective to check up on you.” My ex-father-in-law’s eyes start to tear up while he recounts how it was for his ex-wife to watch the kids and work a full time job and how hard it was for her adn how much pressure was on her. He starts to sound somewhat remorseful. I’m like, “Yeah, exactly. But why are you crying? You had everything easy your whole life. Your crying tears for her now doesn’t make a difference. Your compassion and empathy are a lot too late. You guys are already divorced and your kids are grown and you have a chance to make it up now with your grandson while I do all the work.” My dad is nodding his head in agreement with all this but also looking a little chagrined himself because he was also not doing that great a job of watching his grandson either. I pay the detective and he wanders off. There’s a little bit of what feels like validation and me being seen by these two old men with the understanding of why I’m having them watch my son in the first place. It’s like they’re having a renewed commitment to being good grandparents and not talking shit about their grandson’s mom to him. The dream shifts. I’m in a car and pulling up to a classroom only there are a ton of young college kids taking an exam. I’m twenty minutes late for this exam which is eating into my exam time. I get into the classroom and the teacher sees me and is like, “Pick a spot.” All of the tables seat six or more. There are only single spots left at a couple tables. I am trying to find one that’s not too crowded because they all seem too crowded. I finally find a table where I sit down and go to take the test. I don’t know any of the answers. I notice from the other test-takers that it’s an open book test so they have their books and are allowed to look at their books while they’re taking the exam. I don’t have my books. In fact I didn’t even know I was going to be taking a test, I thought I was just coming to class. I know I’m late and have ten minutes left to take this fat test and I don’t have enough time. I answer maybe two questions before the teacher says time and I have to stand up and turn my test back in. I’m completely disappointed and frustrated with the whole situation. I don’t remember why I was late. I just know it was something unavoidable and I thought it was okay that I was late because I thought it was just going to be lecture and I wouldn’t miss too much and I could just get someone else’s notes. The dream ends with me turning in the test, totally disappointed, knowing I just answered two questions of maybe fifty. The teacher is not budging on giving me any more time at all.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,30/11/2020
91,,31/3/2020,"I’m at the shore and I’m with a couple of different people who keep coming and going, none of whom I know in this reality. There’s a little outcropping of lava that goes out into the ocean and the end of it is where people have done ritual or left offerings to the ocean and it seems to be a very common practice in this place because there are a lot of offerings there. I’m watching these two younger men in their late twenties or early thirties talking to each other in a brotherly way. They’re bashing each other and it’s getting a little bit heated but there’s obviously a bond between them. One of them is saying, “I said the prayer and I put the spell out there and i left the offering out there.” The other brother or whoever it is says, “I keep hearing that you just have to wait. You have to be patient.” I’m watching the waves and the waves are very frothy, where they keep hitting a lot of white water. The two brothers dive in no problem and I see them navigating, they’re not worried about rip tide or getting pulled out or getting smashed on the rocks that are all around. I think they clearly know these waters and this area and they’re navigating this just fine. Then I go somewhere else and I don’t know where. But I come back to this beach. Now the brothers or maybe they’re friends are arguing again. They’re arguing with a white woman with short curly hair cut to her jaw line, blonde. The brothers have darker skin and dark jet black hair. The one who put the spell and offering out at the end of the outcropping has a goatee. She’s kind of haranguing the one who put the offering out there. She’s like, “Why do you even believe in that shit? It’s total bullshit.” He looks at her and is like, “What are you talking about? We know that you’re one of the most powerful psychics in the town.” She’s like, “No I’m not. This is total bullhit. What you’re doing is bullshit. You’re being foolish.“ He asks, “Okay, what did the wizard say?” She stops and drops into a trance and goes, “Merlin says to wait.” She stops haranguing him and gets really quiet then turns around and leaves the beach. He’s like, “Yeah I know that’s what he said because that’s what he said last time, too. Have patience.” I’m watching all of this and I’m not interacting. I feel a little bit of disbelief because the woman was so adament about how spells are stupid and magic is dumb and it’s not real and there’s no such thing as intuition, but then she just drops in and reads what Merlin says to the young man. A little bit of time goes by and I’m still on the beach. The two friends/brothers are still there. There are a bunch of young kids, some moms and their babies, and it’s like a family beach day. The kids are amybe between three and eight. I’m watching the water. The waves are getting bigger. I’m watching the waves pull back and one of the times, they pull back really far and uncover a picnic table. So there’s a picnic table in this area between the rocks where you can get into the water if you want to. I’m like, “What? The water is high enough to cover a picnic table? That’s kind of weird.” The little ones go in. The two brothers are watching and kind of keeping an eye on them because it’s getting a little bit rough. I watch and see a sneaker wave come up. The brothers are watching these kids and I’m like, “Uh oh, this is not going to be good.” The sneaker wave comes and it breaks right over where the kids are. Now I’m like, “Oh shit, they’re all going to drown.” I see the same thoughts go through the one brother’s head. He’s like, “Everyone grab onto my hands, we’re going to go deeper in.” I’m like, “They’re going to drown, you can’t do that.“ He’s like, “They’re going to drown anyway.” I grab one of the kids’ hands and am like, “No they’re not. I’m going to grab them out.” He tells me that I can’t run against the pull of the water because it’s like a tidal wave. I’m like, “Yeah, watch me.” But I can see down the beach that there are moms and babies on the other side. The beach is actually backed by a cliff and there’s only one section where you can get down onto the beach and you have to go up and off to the right and climb up this somewhat steep hill to get up onto this grassy lawn area. The rest of the beach is an alcove with a bunch of cliffs. Moms and kids are nestled up against the cliff supposedly enjoying the beach. I’m like, “Oh no. Everyone is going to die.” I think I get one or two kids’ hands and for whatever reason I have superhuman strength and the pull of the water is not stopping me. I’m dragging them as fast as I can out of the water, up the beach, up this little embankment where it’s not as steep, then up to the top of the cliff. I’m looking down and I see the wave come and it just covers everyone and it splashes up on me because it hits the cliff and does one of those huge sprays. I’m horrified because I know everyone died. The water pulls back a little bit and comes rushing back in. But then it’s suddenly totally calm, there were only two waves. Now it’s completely calm but the water has filled up to almost halfway up the cliffs so the beach is completely gone. I look down and I can see the water is totally smooth, it’s crystal clear and I can see all the bodies. There’s a little girl in a pink sweats outfit and her sister laying on their sides but dead, drowned. I can see further off more bodies of the other children, a mom and her baby, and all these bodies under the water. There’s no sign of these brothers but I know that they somehow got out. Whatever happened to them, they didn’t end up in the water. I can see under the water the outcropping where the rituals were being done and the offerings were made. It’s just so eerie to see all this death. I don’t even know what happens to the two kids that I saved. I don’t know if they ran off or what. There’s so much water and it’s so eerie, there’s clearly magic stuff. It’s very Neptunian because it feels very unreal even in the dream. I turn around and turn my back on the whole thing. I walk across that grassy lawn and up into the little town. In the town, I see a bunch of guys in their late twenties, early thirties. They’re totally hoodlums, like street kids. I walk up to a building where you can get a meal. It’s shingled on the outside and it’s small. It kind of looks like a food truck but it’s actually a building. It’s run by a mom and her female partner, so lesbians. I order some food and I’m watching these guys hanging around and talking to shit to this woman and making her life miserable. They’re total punks and I’m expecting them to pull a gun at any moment. Then they start fighting with themselves. They leave and I start talking to that one brother again. I don’t remember what we’re talking about. Then he leaves and his brother, the one he was arguing with, shows up with one of those punk kids. They’re talking right outside this food place. They are suddenly like, “Fuck you and fuck everything.” One of them has a glass bottle and slams the glass bottle on the side of the shop and smashes it. The other one does the same thing. There are pieces of glass everywhere and crap all over the front of the building. A police officer comes and it’s a black female. She’s totally resigned and she’s not going to do anything. I’m like, “Why aren’t you stopping them?” She’s like, “To do what? Put them in this prison system that doesn’t help them? They’re not going to listen to me anyway. And I could possibly get in trouble for stopping him because one of those kid’s dad is high up.” I’m like, “What?!” The brother I’ve been talking to turns out to be her boyfriend and he’s like, “Yup, we’re just going to go home. I’m taking her home. She’s tired. She’s exhausted. She can’t keep doing what she’s doing. It’s a no-win situation for her.” I just look at them and I realize it’s true. I look back at the owners of this food shop and they’re like totally beat down, too. Even the kids being fucking punks, you can tell they’re so angry and they’re doing it because they feel like they have no future. I think this is such a fucked up dream! Everyone is completely oppressed in this dream except for me, but no one will hear me or listen to me and they’re not listening because they assume I don’t know what they’re talking about and also I’m just a woman who doesn’t know what she’s talking about. They think I don’t know what I’m talking about because I haven’t lived their experience but also I’m female. The whole dream is totally frustrating. But it ends with the one brother taking his police officer woman home and the words he says are: “Babe, let’s go take care of you, you need some self care.” He takes her home and she’s dragging her feet, she’s so fucking exhausted but also beat down and tired. I can see that at least they have ech other and they do as much as they can for each other just like the lesbian couple who owns the food shop. They’re a little bit resigned but they’re still doing what they can do.",Dreamer 8,Rose,BLM,5/12/2020
92,,1/4/2020,"I am with one high school classmate, Janet, and some others - somebody’s parents and some other friends. We’re going to a park where we can camp and there’s also a house and cabins you can rent. We’re celebrating something. It’s very chill. There’s a pond with a slide and a diving platform that are facing each other so there’s literally no room between the slide and the diving platform, so if you were to ride down the slide, you’d end up on the diving platform, or if you wanted to dive off the diving platform, you’d dive right onto the slide. It’s very bizarre and in the very center of the pond which is not even big enough for swimming. There are trees and it’s like a forest. There’s also an open area. We’re there celebrating and I’m actually starting to get concerned because I’m seeing that tons of people are showing up and it’s turning into a crazy mob, like a huge party of college kids. In my mind I'm going, “Uh, coronavirus is up and we’re all going to get coronavirus now, great. This is not okay.” When all the people show up, the pond gets bigger. I’m wading into the water. I’m wearing this one-piece swimsuit and it’s got an eighties vibe because the legs are super high cut and I have a crazy cameltoe going and it’s a shiny burnt orange color. I don’t wear one-piece swimsuits, only when I was on the swim team. My hair is down and I’m standing at the edge of the water pulling some playboy moves. People are watching and I’m getting uncomfortable because I’m there for myself. I came to this thing because it was going to be a small intimate gathering, but now there’s tons of people. There are shenanigans happening everywhere - bottles being broken on the grass, people rocking in their camper vans, loud music playing, people partying at the back of their trucks. It’s crazy. I keep focusing on the slide and diving platform because I want to go down the slide, but it’s too close to the diving platform. Eventually I go in the water and then come out. The water is pretty warm but when I come out, it’s cold, like about to start snowing cold. I bundle myself up and head back to the house that we rented. Now there are way more people in it. I’m crawling into a bed because I’m freezing. I’m first there by myself, but then all these other people show up and they crawl into the bed with me. The other people are older, like aunties and uncles and even grandmas. I’m like, “Nope.” The sun has gone down. I change clothes so I’m warm and I go out of the house. There’s this guy, I don’t know him, maybe in his thirties with short dark hair. I noticed him by the pond earlier because he was there doing some work and he had this bronze statue of himself that was animated. He had made a copy of himself that was helping him with a project down there. When I come out of the house, he’s by the house with his bronze copy of himself. But the copy is misbehaving, it won’t do what he tells it to do. He’s trying to kill it and chop off its head in pieces. I’m a little freaked out by the whole thing because I get this eerie feeling that if he doesn’t do something about that copy of himself it’s going to wreak havoc on everybody and just start killing everyone. At some point, he manages to get control of it and chops it into pieces and puts it on a tarp and wraps the tarp up. I’m kind of grossed out by the whole thing. I don’t know what he does with the tarp. He’s definitely a musician because i see him go from there to setting up a ritual space. He brings all the elements in. He has rings on his fingers. I’m wondering what he’s doing and what he’s setting up. The dream shifts. I end up traveling somewhere else. I’m traveling with Josh. he’s feeling super beat down and his self esteem is in the toilet. He’s picking at acne on his body so badly that it’s leaving holes in his skin. He’s super fucking depressed. I don’t know where we’re traveling to or from. I don’t even know what kind of vehicle we’re in but there are seats. I’m in a seat and he’s in a seat next to me. There’s seaglass, round and smooth, and some are pretty big like the size of the palm of my hand. They’re all different colors, red and purple and greens and blues. There are smaller pieces, too. It’s gorgeous and it’s his personal collection. I’m trying to hang onto this glass while we’re in this vehicle. At some point we’re flying because I look out the window and see clouds below us, but we’re also driving. I put the glass down and all of a sudden the vehicle accelerates and the glass falls off the shelf I put it on and shatters into so many tiny pieces on the metal of the floor of this vehicle. Josh is ambivalent about it and I’m like, “Oh my god, all of your glass!” I’m horrified because I put it there and it broke, but he’s like, “I don’t really care.” I’m super upset about it breaking and I feel bad. I’m also upset that he doesn’t care. I sweep up all the little shards and we put them in the trash. There are a few tiny pieces left and I gather those up and hang onto them. We get to where we’re going and we get out of this vehicle. We end up at a weird saloon bar place. It’s dark. We meet these two women who I think were our travel companions at one point. I don’t know who they are but they’re familiar to me in the dream. One of the women has a blond braid and the other has longer dark hair. They sit down at a table and ask the bartender for this type of alcohol that you usually need one shot of and you’re good. They’re like, “We’ll take the whole bottle.” The bartender is like, “No you won’t.” And they’re like, “Yeah, we will.” Josh is like, “Yeah, let them have it. I’ll take care of them.” I’m looking at him like, “No! They’re going to be obnoxious and terrible.” But by the time I look back, the two women have finished the bottle and the bartender is standing there with shoulders shrugged. I’m like, “Oh no.” Of course they get crazy. Josh starts feeding off of them energetically because he doesn’t drink at all. I’m looking at him like, “Uh oh, this is not going to be good, you’re going from depressed to manic.” They’re playing on a piano. It is like a saloon. There’s nobody else in there. The bartender is like, “And we’re closing.” I’m like, “What do you mean, you’re closing? You just got these two ladies wasted and there’s no place for us to go. We’re staying here.” The dream shifts. I’m not exactly sure where I’m at, maybe a Costco type area. There’s a guy, older man maybe in his fifties, pot-bellied white dude with short hair. He’s used his body his whole life to work, you can tell, his hands are super callused. He’s hungry and he’s trying to figure out what to eat that is healthy. I’m standing looking at everything in the freezer section and am like, “Okay, if you eat this, this and this, it doesn’t have any dairy.” I was trying to find food that met the restrictions he had. I say, “This pizza has a cauliflower crust and it’s non-dairy with fake cheese. It comes with these other items in the box, so you can buy the whole thing and that’s your meal.” There’s a microwave conveniently nearby. He heats it up and eats while we’re standing in the freezer section. He puts the tray down on his shopping cart, eats and enjoys it. The whole time he’s complaining about how expensive it is for him to eat this way even though he needs to because it’s becoming life or death. He needs to start eating in a more healthy way. I’m telling him, “You can complain about the money it costs to buy this food or you can complain about the money it costs for all the healthcare you’re going to need. There are ways to cut down because you can buy food at the beginning of the week and meal prep and that saves money. You have containers in the fridge you can eat.” I’m going through all this stuff I know from my nutrition degree to help him out and simplify things for him. But I don’t know who he is and I don’t know why I’m doing this for him. I don’t know if I’m getting paid for it or not. It seems like a lot of energy being put into this person who keeps saying over and over again, “This is really expensive.” Eventually I’m like, “Do you feel better?” He says yes. I’m like, “Okay, so it’s your choice. You can keep eating shit and keep feeling like shit or you can figure out how to do this. He doesn’t give me a response and I just wake up.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,10/12/2020
93,,2/4/2020,"This dream is all over the place. I’m with some people, I’m not sure who. I’m showing them how to get over a barrier that looks a lot like the plastic plexiglass barriers that we have up now because of coronavirus, between cashiers and people. The barriers are really tall and kind of remind me of a hockey rink. The panels are skinny and narrow though, attached to a solid unbroken bottom foundation. The plexiglass panels bend a lot because I can pull them down almost in half and climb up over them. We climb over them. I don’t know where we’re going, I’m just showing them how to do this. We come to this lake and I’m having a psychic energy session with a psychic, but I don’t know who she is. It’s actually not just her, it’s a whole council of beings so I’m wondering if this is my own council. I know they do some energetic work, but I have one last question for them. I’m like, “Hey I haven’t bled in a while. What’s going on with that?” I’m thinking it’s menopause or something. The guide, a woman with short blond hair, says, “Oh let me look.” She looks and says, “That’s because you’re pregnant, kitten.” She calls me kitten! I’m like, “Oh god, nope. This isn’t good.” I’m not excited about this. I don’t see the other guides in front of me, they’re kind of like a voice in my head because I’m now back at this lake. It’s dark around me and the water is dark. I’m standing on an island. The people I’m with are constantly shifting and changing. I don’t see who they are and don’t recognize any of them. There’s a guy who looks a little like a Star Wars character, the guy who plays Hans Solo and Leia’s son. He is throwing things into the water. I see him pick up a baby by a foot and just wing it into the lake. I’m like, “Is that your child?” He’s like, “Yeah, but I don’t want it and I don’t need it.” I’m like, “If you do that, it’s going to die.” He’s like, “Yup.” I’m shocked and I watch the baby land in the water and never come back up again. I’m horrified. None of the other people say anything. I switch out of this part of the dream. Now I’m on a ship like a huge houseboat that kind of remind me of those big ships that go down the Mississippi with the big wheels in the back that push the water around. They were used in the early days of our country. But it’s rickety and looks like it’s an old house that is falling apart. It’s made of wood and doesn’t have an opening on the top for a sail. It’s enclosed like a house. There are a lot of us on it, but I don’t know anyone. The waves are crazy big and choppy. I notice the boat has a good engine because it’s going really fast. I don’t know who the boat captain is but I think this boat captain obviously knows what he’s doing because he’s keeping speed and he’s going up into the waves so we don’t get swamped. Part of me is like, “Oh my god, what are we doing?” and the other part of me has total trust. So there’s part of me that’s a bit panicked because the waves are huge and also I have no idea why I’m on this boat in the ocean or who I’m with. The other part of me is totally trusting because this boat captain has clearly got it and I’m not too worried. I’m watching as we go out into the waves out into open ocean. I can also see off of one side of the boat, houses on a shore that are also all rickety. We pass by junkyards. The land is torn up quite a bit. You can see jetties where they’ve built up the walls with big huge rocks to stop the surf. I also see broken down cars and broken down trucks that are old and rusty. The yards have buoys in them. Everything is very rundown and not taken care of. I don’t see any people out there. I also don’t see many people on the boat with me, I just know they’re there. We go out and then turn around and come back on this boat. I don’t know where we’re going or where we’ve come back to, but there’s purpose and again it’s me just trusting that the boat captain knows what they’re doing. Now I’m talking to this guy who looks a little like my next door neighbor. He’s like, “Oh I’m heading to the gym. You need to come to the gym with me. We need to get off this boat with me and go.” He’s kind of flirting with me and I’m not exactly sure what his intentions are or why I need to go with him. I’m like, “Okay, I’m not doing anything else and I actually really want to get off, so let’s go to this gym.” Suddenly we’re there and it’s more like a fitness spa with a lot of amenities. We’re walking down the hall towards the weight room. I see this family of a mom and three kids, I don’t see the dad, I hear someone in my head say, “Oh they’re half Japanese, half white.” I’m like, “Okay.” They show up and the mom is trying to herd the two girls and boy. It looks like they’ve been in a pool and now she’s trying to get them home and out of this fitness center. The two little girls and especially one of them, are taken with me and want to be with me. The one girl wants my towel. I give it to her. Their hair is all wet. She’s talking with me and I’m entertaining and indulging her. The mom says, “Okay, sweetie, it’s time to go.” She takes the kids and they disappear. The guy and I get back to our conversation. We were talking about something important, it was an ongoing conversation that started on the boat. We resume this conversation. The mom comes back with the towel. The towel is super thin and ratty, not very big, the size of a child’s towel, and I feel like it has Snoopy printed on it somewhere. It’s damp and she has it all wadded up. She hands it back to me and is like, “I see that my daughter took this from you. I’m so sorry, here you go.” I’m like, “Don’t worry about it. I gave it to her. Not a big deal. Thank you for bringing it back to me.” Then she disappears. That’s all I can remember from the dream.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,20/12/2020
94,,3/4/2020,"I’m with Josh but he doesn’t look or feel like him. We’re at a huge house, like his parents’ house, and his whole extended family are there. Interesting enough, the parents are parents of a friend of mine from growing up, so they aren’t his actual parents. Grandma and Grandpa, siblings and spouses are there. So we’re in this place and I feel kind of out of place like I’m not really welcome there because I’m just the girlfriend. This is a very strange feeling. They don’t believe in or agree with anything I’m saying. Whatever input I’ve made, they’re constantly judging and looking at me. At some point I hear the mom tell Josh, “She’s no good for you. Don’t be with that person.” This is crazy. I’m getting this feeling that they’re super rich and I’m not, so I’m not fitting in that way as well. I go out to the backyard. I can see a view of beautiful mountains and I can feel all of that calling me. I want to go out there. But then I get called back to the inside and that’s when I hear the mom talking shit about me. I go down and lay in the bed. I keep coming back to this bed. The dream starts with me in the bed and then I come back to sleep. Josh is with me sometimes and other times he’s not. The second time I leave the bed the house is transformed into a college campus. There are college aged kids with backpacks hurrying all over the place. I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m still feeling really out of place, like I can’t relate to what they’re talking about or with what they’re interested in. I’m not taking any classes. Then I go back to this bed. I’m laying in the bed and look up to my right. There's a huge bird that looks like a cross between a stork and a flamingo with a long neck and long legs. I don’t remember what color it is. It’s standing next to this gigantic mushroom. Then there’s a smaller really colorful bird hopping around on the ground. I’m seeing all of this from the bed. I think Josh is with me this time. I’m like, “Whoa, where is this? Where is this strange interlude?” I get up and realize there’s something I need to do. I need to change my clothes. I look down to see what I’m wearing. I’m wearing khaki joggers and a white old navy t-shirt. It’s a very yuppy outfit. I’ve got a backpack, too. It’s not what I need to be wearing. I start climbing up the steps to go back to my dorm room. I’m like, “Why do I need to change? I don’t care.” I turn back around and head back to this bed. I see a corset with garters on the bed and am like, “Yeah, that’s what I want to wear.” I go to put the corset with garters on. It has a heart shape in the front. I’m like, “Yep, this is more me.” But then I go out in this and everyone is like, “What are you wearing?” My ass is hanging out and I’m wearing a thong, garters and corset. Again, I’m not fitting in this place at all. This whole time, Josh is kind of there but kind of not. He’s certainly not engaging with me. I go back to the bed one more time. Now there’s a young girl on a treadmill. She starts running then puking. I’m like, “What is happening?” She’s like, “Oh I think I have the virus.” I’m like, “Oh my god, get away from me.” I do not want to catch that. She leaves. I’m wanting to climb into my bed but realize it’s time to go. I start to pack my stuff into my backpack. I find a pair of jean shorts on the ground and they’re covered in puke. I’m like, “Oh god, this is not what I want. I do not want this anywhere near me.” I wake up and am feeling nauseous.",Dreamer 8,Rose,pandemic,2/1/2021
95,,4/4/2020,"I’m in a house. It’s not my childhood home or even my home. I think it’s my mom’s home. I’m there to see her. I think I’m my current age. I’m sitting in the corner of the kitchen where the cabinets come together. I’m sitting on the floor. She’s yelling at me. My little brothers are there. They’re little again. My brother that was born right after me is also there, but he looks like he’s maybe just out of his teenage years. So maybe I’m in my early twenties. She’s yelling at me and my two youngest brothers. My other brother and I are going to take the kids on a trip. We’re going to the grocery store. We go to the grocery store in his white Tacoma truck (he doesn’t have one in real life). My brothers are in the car with us. We go to the grocery store and get all of our supplies. Then we go to check out and my brother decides the lines are too long for him and he’s pissed off. So he decides to take the cart full of groceries and somehow get them in the truck that’s now in the store. He drives the truck through these two doors. The regular sliding doors are not an option because there are a ton of people in there and a rent-a-cop. There are these two doors on the side which I don’t think a truck can fit through, but he drives through them anyways. The truck barely makes it through. He heads out into the parking lot which is full of people. I’m pissed at him like, “You just fucking stole groceries! And you almost run over people. We need to go back.” He circles around the huge parking lot. He’s trying to park but we’re on a side of the building with an entire school’s worth of parents and kids. The kids are running around. This is where he decides to park. I’m getting more and more pissed because at any moment the cops are going to come and arrest us for stealing groceries even though I didn’t steal them. I’m also afraid he’s going to hit some of the kids running around this parking lot. The kids are kindergarten up through fifth or eighth grade. He parks in one stall that’s totally open with no one nearby. But then he decides he doesn’t like it, pulls out of it, and goes to find another spot to park. This stall is in between a minivan and SUV that have parked next to each other, but they haven’t parked straight, so the stall in between is not large enough for the truck. They parked so that no one could park near them because their kids are running around. But he picks that stall to park in. i’m like, “What the fuck is wrong with you?! You’re acting entitled. You’re not paying attention to other people and your surroundings. We need to pay for these groceries.” I finally get the groceries out of the truck and there are so many that I have to get two carts, so I put them head to head, which is kind of strange. He pushes them in, but he’s trying to go in the out doors. I’m like, “You’ve got to go over to the side where it says, In.” Because he was trying to go In the Out, there’s chaos with the amount of people at the checkout. We can’t actually make it in so we have to go in these other doors. We have to go around to get to the cash registers and pay. We’re on our way around and I’m pushing the cart. Somehow this guy with a baby on his back and holding the hand of a toddler, I manage to trip him. Really what happens is he wasn’t paying attention as I was trying to squeeze behind him. He turns and he trips. I’m like, “Oh my gosh, are you okay?” He gets really upset. I’m like, “I’m really sorry. I should have made more noise so you could hear that I was behind you. Are you okay? Is the baby okay?” He stands up and starts to yell at me and my brother because in our hurry, we don’t have our masks on. This guy also doesn’t have his mask on because he’s pulled it down around his neck. He’s like, “I’m going to have to cite you.” I’m like, “Nope, hang on, don’t worry. I have my mask right here.” I pull my mask out to put it on and my brother pulls his mask out to put it on. I’m thinking this guy is going to be more upset about tripping and falling, but he’s more upset about the masks.",Dreamer 8,Rose,election,11/1/2021
96,,5/4/2020,"I’m on a college campus - it’s not one I’ve ever been on before. There are a lot of college kids. A strange lockdown is happening with very strict rules about which buildings we can be and when and if we can be outside. No one is allowed off the campus for our safety. It’s kind of like pandemic times, but none of us are wearing masks. I’m not sure why we have all these rules. The buildings are strange, a mix of really old and really modern. Part of the buildings are falling apart, but their design is modern. I’m in a gymnasium trying to work out. There are floor to ceiling windows and the ceiling is three to four stories high. There’s glass on this one wall and I’m looking out at an atrium filled with plants and lots of light coming in. This guy I knew from college is there. He was a prick who hated the fact that I became a personal trainer before him and passed all the tests before him and was basically smarter than him. He was a chauvinistic asshole. I found papers that he had written to my boss when I had gotten my boss’ afterwards complaining about me. He was a whiny little entitled bitch! He’s in the dream whining at me. In the dream I’m like, “Nope. Bye.” I was sitting on a stationary bike staring out the windows when he came up to me. He had a client with him and was being passive aggressive and saying shitty things. So I left. I head outdoors. It’s raining and the rain is worrisome because an alarm starts to sound. I’m walking around and see a bunch of college kids hanging out in this fenced area outside connected to their dorm room. They’re basically just parting and there’s music. I see other buildings with classrooms where teaching is happening. So the alarm goes off because of the rain. I head indoors, but then am like, “Oh, I actually need to be outside.” But once I head indoors it’s like a labyrinth and I can’t get out. Everyone else is sheltering and hiding out. I’m walking under and through all these buildings. The buildings keep getting older and older, but they look more and more futuristic. It kind of reminds me of the futuristic stuff they built in the 1950s, but because they built them then, they’re now like seventy years old. I’m wandering through. The walls are white. The lighting is weird and blue. I get to this really old building and am like, “Who goes here? What do they teach here?” Engineering, I think. I’m trying to get out and there are escalators I’m trying to go down. The escalators are like tunnels with plastic shielding overtop. It gets really narrow at the bottom and you really have to crouch or lay all the way back to be spit out this escalator. I go down one and am like, “Uh, I don’t want to do that again.” I’m going down halls trying to get out of this building. There’s someone with me who I’m trying to get out with, but I don’t know who it is. I don’t recognize anyone else in the dream or the teachers and professors that come up to talk to me. I get to the end of this building and then there’s another escalator. It’s really narrow at the end and totally claustrophobic. When I get out of this narrow channel, there are doors opening to the outside. The windows and doors are glass and I can see through. It’s still raining but there’s a fear that these buildings are going to collapse because they’re so old. I get out. As soon as I get out, there’s a professor saying, “Yup you want to get out. Good job.” As I’m passing through their lab, there are two animals, maybe bunnies. The professor is like, “Take the bunnies with you.” As they open the cage doors, a bunch of other animals are getting out. I’m opening the door to the outside and a bunch of animals get out. The animals are so excited to be out and free and they’re talking to me. There is a mated pair of bunnies talking to each other about being outside and free. One of the bunnies loses sight of its mate and there’s a bit of panic, but then they’re reunited. There’s also a cat talking to me. The cat is telling me which direction to go once I get outside. We head out to an open field with a pasture with horses and a fence. There’s a lane that would take me down to an area that’s no longer the college, a completely different vibe. The cat is telling me to head in that direction. The cat is black.",Dreamer 8,Rose,election,13/1/2021

I was half asleep going “oh it’s an earthquake, be calm, you’ll be fine, get my daughter.” Then I open my eyes and realize it was an explosion and there was lava or fire. I don’t know if the earth cracked open or a giant super volcano exploded and there was lava everywhere or if an asteroid had hit the earth. I don’t know what it was, but it wasn’t just an earthquake.

So I’m looking for my daughter and I can’t find her. I’m freaking out. I’m running around and sobbing and calling for her.

Where’s my daughter?!” And they’re like, “Oh, I don't know.” Then I see one of my daughter’s friend’s mom. I ask her and she doesn’t know. Nobody is freaking out.

I’m really trying to get my daughter and myself to a safe place where this person can’t get near us. It was weird.",Dreamer 6,Mary,BLM,6/1/2021

At first it is mesmerizing, and then we realize that it is rising and will flood the deck and possibly drown us all. I yell to someone to help me hold onto my son, as I’m terrified that he’ll be lost in the wave. In another scene, I’m in LAX, but it could also be a casino. There is a mass of people - a huge crowd - like a music concert mosh pit. It feels threatening. A TSA agent shows me a way to the side where it’s not as crowded. She then shows me her forearm with a tattoo of a unicorn. It’s a 3D tattoo and as she moves her arm, the unicorn seems to come alive. Then there is a child with a stuffed animal that is part dog (or something) and part giraffe. Another person has a similar beast.

I recall a moment of consciousness in the dream where Ana Forrest, one of my yoga teacher trainers, is leading a group of us in different exercises. We are assembled. There are only a few of us, a scattered remain of people who survived. There’s dust in the air, smoke obscuring the sky, and everything is muted with this dust and smoke. She’s guiding us through these physical embodiment exercises to cultivate energy and joy again in our bodies. We have almost forgotten how this feels in our body because we have been so tightly controlled by fear and these other exercises that have kept us under control - emotionally, mentally, physically.

My husband, another man, and I unsettle a man that’s been sleeping. We nudge at his shoulders and try to wake him up, interfering with his sleep. He starts to grumble. Then we realize that it’s a really dangerous thing we’ve done - waking him up. He’s now after us with a gun. I run downstairs and move a bench out of the way next to a bed and shimmy under the bed. I’m hiding there and I can see under the bed that it’s dusty with moth balls. I also see one of my son’s winter hats and one of my malas. Then I realize that I’ve forgotten the light and it’s still on. So I start to scooch out to turn off the light. As I do this, my husband comes into the room and says the guy has gone back to sleep, but he’s not fully asleep. He’s levitating with his arms reaching up to the sky, in an interesting dream state, so we’re okay. He’s not going to come after us with his gun. So my husband and I join the other man - the one who helped us wake him up - in the kitchen and I start putting away the dishes. It’s really early morning and dark - the sun has started to rise.",Dreamer 1,Ana,pandemic,19/2/2020

I start teaching. Then I turn away and look back. There is only a scattering of people. Most everyone has left and their mats are abandoned in a haphazard way, overlapping each other. It’s odd and doesn’t feel right for me to continue teaching. So I wrap up and I don’t even teach savasana. As I’m walking out, the teacher who used to teach this class walks past me and into another room. The chairs are lined up for a film showing and talk. I say hello, but there is a bit of awkwardness as I leave. In the next part of the dream, I see Victoria in her younger self - the one before she was married and became a mother, and before she was focused on her current business. I see her go into a glass house. She sets a fire that turns the glass black and opaque. I go inside hoping she’s still alive. She is passed out on a couch holding a cigarette. I’m amazed she hasn’t burnt up. I pull her onto the deck and try to resuscitate her. I try to call 911 on my cell phone, but then hear music. I look down confused and see I dialed 933. I panic and try to call 911 again, but then think I need to call her partner. She’s still not breathing. Then I wake up.",Dreamer 1,Ana,pandemic,10/3/2020

He’s really looking forward to this man because he’s a very good kisser. But the man’s body is so distorted - he’s overweight, his face is pock marked with red oozing blisters, his eyes are drooping. He decides to bring his boyfriend who is short and stocky. I’m not happy about the situation but there’s nothing I can do about it. Later in the night, my husband returns from a hotel room. He’s really disappointed because the guy and his boyfriend just fucked each other the whole time and he was like okay, where am I in this whole situation? I asked him if he got off and he said yes. Then we’re still in this hotel and people are looking at each other with a lot of fear and distrust, moving rooms and packing bags and trying to decide where to go. Now I’m sitting in a hotel room all by myself and preparing to get on an online Zoom call ritual with some sisters. In order to prepare, I first spray the area around me in all directions with a chamomile-based spray. The next procedure in order to sign onto the call is to spray Lysol in every direction, so I do that. Then the scene shifts again. I am at another hotel - it’s a boutique hotel. There is a sinister plot going on - the servants are planning to kill their masters. There are hidden guns and hidden agendas. I can’t recall much more. Then we’re all downstairs at community dinner. More people arrive and a couple are wearing N95 masks over their faces. One of them comes up and stands right behind me and takes off his mask. He wants to introduce me and the little girl sitting in my lap to a friend of his. The little girl is his granddaughter. I’m really upset that he’s breathing on me and that these people walked into our dining room obviously sick and just off a plane or boat. The scene shifts. I’m outside walking along a marina. There is shallow water with rocks like tidepools. I look down into the water and see two black and white cats curled together in a circle. They are all wet. I think it’s odd that the cats are so pleasantly sleeping floating on the water. I keep walking and see a couple drenched yellow chicks. I wonder if they’ve drowned or if they’re also sleeping. Then I see a turkey struggling on its back in the water between rocks. I see pigs doing the same along with some other animals. It’s a very odd scene.",Dreamer 1,Ana,pandemic,15/3/2020

As we’re climbing in, a huge fireball shoots over our head and makes a big hole in the wall, going all the way through, singeing everything in the house before making a hole through a bathroom wall and exiting. I’m worried about how the fireball has damaged the house and try to cover up the burned furniture, plants and art. I’m trying to get everyone out and to the street, so we can escape. That’s all we do, or at least all I can recall. In the next scene, I’m standing in a beautiful room on the second floor of a house. There’s a large window with a view of a body of water - either river or ocean. I look up at the sky and the clouds are so beautiful - they look like the white foam of ocean waves. So there is a beautiful body of water below and sky above. I’m in awe. Then a woman comes into the room. She is an indigenous woman with brown skin. She says, “I was referred to you for healing by some women in my Universal Peace Dance Group.” She lists the women, but I don’t recognize their names as members of my practice. Erin and Sophia. So she lies down on the bed - it’s not a chiropractic or massage table, but an actual bed with blankets and pillows. We don’t discuss her history or any of her concerns. I just start working with her and telling her about this work. Her body is responding and moving in a kundalini wave. It’s amazing to witness. Then I notice her hair - it looks like it is growing back from chemotherapy treatments. At the same time, my son is in the kitchen and no one is watching him. He’s playing with the water from the fridge. He’s pouring water into his cup. Then he notices me and comes over. I’m concerned that I don’t have anyone to take care of him and that he’s disturbing the session.

People are getting their hair and makeup done, and I wait to have mine done, too. I wander around looking at art. There are huge beautiful pieces and odd pieces. People are wandering around looking, too. Then I look at the time and I realize I need to get the show. It’s 11pm but still twilight.

113,,22/4/2020,"I am at a building that appears to be an unemployment office, though it’s more of a nice community center and rest stop along a highway. I’m filing for unemployment and looking for support. While I’m inside, I look out the window at my car. My car is a convertible and the top is off. A man is sitting in the passenger seat. He’s scruffy and older looking of mixed ethnicity - at one point he seems Chinese and another African. I make a move towards the car to tell him to get out, but then he slides a gun across his lap and points it toward me. The gun is upside down and pointed at me as a warning to stay back. So I don't say anything to him. I go back inside and a woman notices that I’m disturbed. She asks me about it, but she can do nothing to help me. So I’m at a loss. The dream shifts to the next day at the same time. I’m waiting for help. He happens to be inside, too. The woman who I spoke with yesterday comes out and apologizes to me that we are here at the same time and that he could be near me. I say, “Don’t worry about it, it’s okay. He doesn’t seem to be threatening today.” I notice that he’s just standing there, leaning against a wall, trying to get help, too. Then I wander around. At the back, there is an outdoor patio and some of my friends are there. One of my friends suggests we have a glass of wine. So we go to order wine. There are so many choices, but no menu. So we have to guess and give words to the man serving the wine, describing the taste profile or experience we desire. He pulls out a bag of sarsaparilla and cloves and holds it open for us to smell. We enjoy the smell and he gives us a mason jar of red wine that has this flavor profile. While he’s serving us, he tells us that he used to have a job that paid $35/hour and he misses that regular pay because now he is just living on tips. We thank him and each pay him $5 for the wine and $1 tip. He says again, “I still wish I had that job where I was getting paid 35 a month.” I think, “Hmm a month? Didn’t you see 35 an hour? 35 a month is not a lot.” I don’t say anything, though. The dream shifts and I’m walking through a building. It appears to be a school. It’s on complete lockdown and all the doors are bolted - some are bolted shut and others are locked partially open. The halls are completely empty. The rooms are emptying. I’m carrying a glass of red wine in my hand, peering into windows and rooms. As I’m walking down one hallway, a naked and very full woman is walking towards me with a swaddled baby. It appears she has just given birth. We nod at each other, but say nothing as we pass. She’s the only person I’ve seen so far. I turn left and am walking down a hallway. I peer through a doorway and see a woman dressed in black. She’s squatting as if giving birth, but she’s already given birth. Her baby is on the floor beside her. She is wailing and keening. The carpet under her mouth is soaking wet with tears, saliva and snot. She is retching and I can’t tell if she’s actually throwing up. I walk past and then turn back. Now this same room is full of mothers who have recently given birth. This is a support meeting for them being facilitated by my midwife. I go in but am embarrassed to have red wine and put it on the desk. I leave, but forget my wine. I go back, but can’t find it on the dresser where I had placed it. Then the dream shifts. I’m in a very nice house with a loft where I have been sleeping and resting. I climb down the ladder and see one of my roommates from freshman year of college. She tosses me a baby food pack of pureed vegetables. It’s nearly empty, but I’m grateful to even have that little bit. The car from earlier in the dream has now been given to my brother-in-law.

I do this, leaving only a few flowers in a simple, lovely arrangement. Then I reach over the log to remove a flower lei and suddenly see the log is not a log, after all.

I’m dancing in the rain down a street with a man - in a pas de deux - enjoying the thrill of being tossed, caught and twirled with such strength and grace. Another scene with blood. Another scene of a family dinner. The family is people of African descent, not a lot of money, living in a shabby but cozy home. They serve simple food. This family dinner happens once a week. The first week is awkward. I’m not really welcome because I’m not part of the family, but they allow me to stay and eat and return each week. After time, I am part of the family.

I get a little distracted on my phone and am not paying attention to the exits. I end up going off a sideroad and am really confused. I see gates ahead of me - like gates to a cemetery. There are a couple people standing at the gate, wearing masks and long dresses. They open the gate to let me through. I drive into the parking lot and am wondering if this will bring me back to the highway because I have somewhere to go. I’m in the parking lot of a big public meeting place - like a town hall or general community center. I park and tell my husband and my son that I’ll be right back. They stay in the car. I go inside. There’s a gathering of people. They invite me in. I take off my shoes. It’s a church service. I sit down. They’re meeting here in secret because they can't meet in the big church without being found out. So I kind of like the message and it’s kind of nice to be there, but I’m not really wanting to be here. I also realize time has passed and my husband may be upset that I didn’t come right back. I tell them that I may be back and I leave. My husband and my son are playing ball in the parking lot. Then I’m in a scene with another group of people. We are outdoors by the river at covered picnic tables. They are preparing for a wedding reception. I don’t feel like I belong here. Maybe I wasn’t invited? They are inside now and I follow. They are doing dances and rituals. I leave because I don’t feel like I’m wanted. Then a patient texts me for an appointment. I make arrangements to see him right away. I am waiting in a massage room - it’s not my office as it is small and cluttered. I’m wearing tight pants - not what I like to work in - so I take them off to be more comfortable while I wait for him. Then he walks in unannounced without knocking. I’m sitting at the end of the table and trying to adjust my shirt so it’s long enough to cover me. He’s standing at the door and is holding plastic golf tees. He’s telling me about these specialized tees - some have gears to make them rise up or down, others are broad or have shelves to keep the ball from rolling off. He shows them to me, but advises me to be very careful because of the small moving parts. Then he lies down on the table and asks where my husband is. I say, “Well, you texted me.” He’s disappointed and says, “Well, I guess I can have your lighter work, but I wanted your husband. I just assumed it would be your husband because in the past when I texted you, you made the appointment with your husband.” He lays down on his back, and I tell him to lay on his left side. Then he rolls to his right side, and I say again, left side. I’m trying to position him this way, so I can discreetly stand up and readjust my clothes. He keeps talking and looking over his shoulder. I’m thinking this is very awkward, not sexual, but not a professional situation.",Dreamer 1,Ana,pandemic,22/4/2020

The water is black from the storm and the night I see this animal that looks like a dead whale being pushed around on the waves. I struggle up to the whale to see if it is alive and if it could be saved. I know it is dangerous, but I do it anyway. As I reach to hold the whale, it turns into a prehistoric or alien creature, close in size to a sea turtle, but alien in shape and texture. Now I’m trying to keep a hold of this creature and bring us both to the shore. I see other people I know in the water and we are all diving under the waves to swim in calmer depths. When I come up for breath, I notice people in rowboats. They are not good people. They are wanting to capture this creature and take it from me. I need to work harder to hold on and swim deep under the water to safety. They see me one time when I go get a breath of air, and I feel like I’m in grave danger. Somehow I get away. I reach an underwater city. I open a door into an empty room and then go through another door to a cobbled street. I am still underwater, but can breathe and move easily. I must keep going and hold this creature close to me because they could get me at any moment. Then in another part of the dream, I am with my friend, George and a friend of his who I don’t know. I have a phone and an iPad. We need to get to a concert and the address and transportation information about the buses are on the devices. I’m worried that it’s time to go and we might miss the first bus. George says, “Don’t worry, we’ll make it.” Then I say I have to put on my makeup. He says, “You don’t need to wear makeup, girl.

It’s nighttime - an unusual time for surgery. When the surgery is over the man says it’s okay for us to go visit her. As I go into the bedroom, I see there are big potted plants - they look like plumeria trees, but aren’t. I’m surprised because just during the short amount of time of the surgery, bright yellow flowers have bloomed on bright yellow stalks. I’ve never seen this before and didn’t know this plant could grow such flowers. I point it out to another woman who is equally amazed. At first I think it was just one big tree, then I see that the “tree” is actually made up of multiple potted plants and maybe these flowers were just brought in, rather than a miracle. Then I see Mary is waking up. The man comes up to me and tells me she will need hot chocolate or matcha for an endorphin boost. He asks if I have either of those in my kitchen, and I think I do - though I’m staying in a rental house and am not sure about what is in the cupboards. He says “Okay, that’s great.” Mary is starting to come back around and is looking around, refreshed but weak. We gather her up and help her out to the kitchen. We need to get her home to rest and have her hot chocolate or matcha. Conversations are happening in the kitchen, but I can't recall what was said. Now we need to get dinner because we missed it while she was in surgery. So we go outside to a village (like Squaw Valley) and down big steps to a dessert cafe. We stand in line at the cafe and I’m now with one of my yoga students and clients, Natalie, and another yoga student. I look in my pockets and realize I don’t have any money. I tell them I need to go home to get money and fill up my pockets. It’s dark and I’m walking down a sidewalk. I see two homeless people who don’t seem quite all together in the head. They are dressed up as Christmas clowns. They are passing a plastic thing back and forth. They see me and want to give me this plastic thing. I am trying to avoid them. I don’t want to touch it or be near them because of the COVID. I veer away, but one starts to follow me. I’m not sure if it is threatening or not, and so I continue on without looking back.

Before I see them, I am watching people on rafts in a big wide river. It’s dark, nighttime. The rapids at this part of the river are quite rough and throwing the rafts around. Some people are chasing other people. Someone falls into the river and is nearly drowned by the water and other people holding his head down. Later, people are recovering on the riverbank around bonfires. There are two bonfires near each other. I can see that the outline of the further fire is making outlines of mystical beings. People are being divided into expedition teams to go out into the night again. Then, the COVID/Outlander/Simpsons scene: sometimes the people are portrayed as Simpson cartoons with medical masks. They are also wearing masks in their human form. There are several reunions - it’s like my dream psyche is trying on different scenarios to find the most romantic storyline. One is a kitchen, one is a cave and one is a rock pillar tower underground. Each scene has a collection of colored rocks and Claire and Jamie meeting again for the first time in 11 years with the big embrace and kiss. They are looking at the rocks - plain rocks, but colored naturally in yellows, reds and blues like the rocks at the river near The Painted Hills - in waking life, we went to this river last weekend. While the kiss is happening, the boys walk in. Jamie and Claire have a son and he has two friends - the sons of Jamie’s wife. Their son is happy, but the other two are angry.

There is another scene where I am leaving an AirBnB house with Veronica, Gail, Irene and my sister. We were on retreat discussing current events, racism and ant-racism. The ladies are getting in the car. I’m hanging around cleaning up the kitchen. The kitchen is a big mess and a woman arrives to help me clean. I’m putting dishes and foods away and making sure we bring home the dishes and foods that belong to us. My son is with the other ladies and they’re waiting for me. They say, “Come on, Viviane. We’re going to get back to the city really late and we’ve gotta go. It’s already after 3 and we won’t be home until after 9 now.” We were supposed to leave in the morning. I’m impressed with how the woman has cleaned the kitchen. I take my son’s hand and we go across the street and across the dirt medium. My friends tell me to watch out for the little dog.

As I look, I realize, it’s not a life-sized cardboard cutout image of her, but it’s actually her. She sees me, releases the pose and walks to me. I am amazed by her height. She is towering over me. I give her a hug and my face is at the level of her yoni. She is about to teach a full day workshop series at the studio. Right now it’s 3am and her first class starts at 5. I have other obligations during the day, so I can't go. I could have gone to this first class, but don’t. I putter around my day. There is a woman that I knew from elementary school. She has rigged the elections to be something like a homecoming queen. There are quite a few obligations and functions she’s participating in to raise funds for the school. She’s doing a great job and has the perfect southern smile and hospitality, but she wasn’t actually fairly elected. The administration realizes it and are debating whether to remove her or keep her because she is doing her job so well and has raised so much money.",Dreamer 1,Ana,election,26/6/2020
126,,5/5/2020,"I’m driving along a beautiful lush coastline, maybe Oregon, maybe Ireland, maybe Hawaii. I’m going to a hotel with a small group of people for an educational high level training of some kind. I don’t recall who was there, except for Jeremy. Zoe is still alive, but she’s at their house and near her death. We arrive and are settling in. Somewhere around three o’clock, Jeremy gets a call from Zoe. She's distressed and feels very close to death. He, unusually, denies it and her because she’s been having similar experiences and it’s been more stressful and anxiety producing than real. So he hangs up the phone. I go into meditation. I see her in the courtyard outside their house - but it’s not their house in waking life. She’s dancing barefoot on the concrete ground. She gets really tired and turns off the music. She goes to the deck and lays her head down on the wooden deck and falls asleep for the last time. Somehow, we found out she has died. I know the exact moment because of my vision - it was in that three o’clock afternoon after, like 3:11pm. I gather my things to go with Jeremy over to the house. All the arrangements have been made by her friends. There are interactions in the hotel before we left, but I can’t recall them now. There’s a sense we will be spending the night together. We make the winding drive back along the coast to the house. When we arrive, her friends have laid her body out in the barn. Pema is there along with other friends who I’ve seen in passing. They’re preparing for the funeral or celebration of life. They’re slicing lemons in the kitchen and in the garden gathering flowers. They’re also gathering and writing poetry and preparing for guests. We go inside. People are sitting in rows. I sit by myself at the end of a row. I turn around and there are people looking at me. They are people from my past who I don’t remember as I’ve lived in many places and known many friends and forgotten many people. They share their memories of me and how they haven’t forgotten me. They’ve even waited for me to return, and I never did and I didn’t remember them. There is one man in particular who I’m drawn to - he’s a Pacific Islander, very robust and of the islands. I’m deeply attracted to him and wonder what is between us. I also see deep pockmarks on his face from cystic acne when he was younger. There’s a woman sitting next to him who also has scars on her face from acne. The people are so crowded and sitting close together. The ceremony is about to begin. I’m a little concerned that we could all catch the coronavirus if anybody had it. I begin to lift my collar over my face, but decide against it and instead intend to breathe in my own space. People are singing and saying poetry for Zoe. It’s a beautiful ceremony. Some time passes. Jeremy tells me that Zoe has been moved to the grey house and there will be a viewing. He invites me to go. I walk in and see people sitting at banquet tables. Immediately I see my grandmother and she’s sitting next to my grandfather. My uncles are with them and so are Aunt Frieda and Bertie (they are twins and my grandmother’s sisters) and other people who are family - perhaps my grandmother’s other siblings. I’m overjoyed to see her and it’s so real, except that everyone has an otherworldly shine and vitality that is a more than human vitality. I don’t ever talk to my grandmother. I hug my uncles who are both still alive in waking life. I go to the end of the row and connect with my great aunt.",Dreamer 1,Ana,pandemic,10/7/2020
127,,6/5/2020,"I am a black woman. They are doing my makeup - my eyebrows are in the wrong place. They draw them lower and do my eyes with thick eyeliner, shadow and mascara. They then start to put foundation on my face - it’s much lighter than my skin tone. They are covering up my natural brows and the rest of my face in a very thick application. I look in the mirror and do like what I see, but am concerned about how I’ll look when the makeup fades during the day and after I wash my face at night. Now, we are entering New York City through a portal. We are taken through a series of halls and rooms, peering in through glass windows. I am taken to a room with a large bed. The man who lives here is very wealthy and eccentric. He has strange sexual tastes and there is an understanding that we all must participate in some way to get out of here and continue on our journey. Now I'm in a basement or garage with a team. We need to find clues; each clue leads to the next. We’re doing well, but someone has tampered with the room and one of the clues in the sequence is missing. The floor is grey cement. There are shelves of books and odds and ends. There are other odd contraptions throughout the space. It’s dark with just a dim garage light. I’m now going to a performance in a theater. My husband and I don’t have tickets. When we arrive, they show us to our box seats. I see a friend from town and her husband. Their son is just a few days older than my son. We are taken to the seats front and center - very conspicuous. Now, I am in the portal rooms again. The man is in bed under the covers with at least three other people. I am standing at the side of the bed and ask him about the mattress composition. He says it’s made of wormwood. Interesting. There are beads of creamy substance in the seams. I pick them up and roll them into a ball and think it’s some kind of glue leaking through. I show it to him and ask him what it is. He pops it in his mouth, eats it and gives me a look. He laughs at my naivety.",Dreamer 1,Ana,BLM,12/7/2020

Someone goes to look through the peephole and sees a threatening looking man - big and rough, a local Hawaiian guy. There’s a whole busload of big, rough guys. I also see Tan France from the “Queer Eye” show. We realize that if we stay here, our lives will be in danger. We don’t open the door and we don’t let them in, but they know we’re inside. Eventually they give up for now and drive away. We know that if we stay, it could be a problem. We pack up and bring our plant starters in the RV. We drive a bit and are supposed to rendezvous with someone with a mask to buy and bring to my brother-in-law. We park the RV in a field for the night. A big truck comes driving towards us really fast and stops just in front of us. We’re afraid it might keep going and run into us. Someone knocks on our door, but we don’t want to open the door because we don’t know who they are or what they could bring with them. They end up opening the door themselves. I see a couple Latina girls. We know their family and realize these are the people who we are supposed to meet up with. The mom and dad come in and we’re concerned that all these people are in a small space. She shows us this mask - it’s like a Gonzo mask, rubber and blue with a bulbous nose - one of her creations. She shows us how to wear it - she puts it over her nose and then says, “When I take it off, I just pull it down over my waist like this.” I don’t think she realizes how this looks like a strap-on.",Dreamer 1,Ana,pandemic,21/7/2020

A nurse is sitting at a desk and we line up in front of her. I’m about in the middle of the line. The nurse is spraying a vaccine mist for SARS-CoV-2 in front of each person’s nose and requiring them to sniff deeply to bring it in. She does not explain what it is or how it works. I comply the first time because it does not seem too harmful for my body, but I try not to breathe it in deeply. But the next time around, she takes out a long thin needle connected to a vat of the vaccine. When it’s my turn, I say no. I am firm but non-violent in my resistance. She has been prepared for this scenario. So instead of poking me with the needle, she pushes a stronger dose of the nasal mist up into my nostrils. I can’t breathe through my right nostril at first, but she continues to be steady and persistent in her administration of the proper dose. I do eventually take it in. i am allowed to go home. I stop at a doctor’s office for some reason. I see another mother from town. There’s some kind of dance with distancing and gauging whether it’s okay now to be near each other, talk or communicate in any way. I go home, but it’s not really my home. I’m in a room on the third floor. People are gathered downstairs in the courtyard, drinking and eating. I stand at the window watching. A foreign man sees me. He saw me at the doctor’s office, too, and was attracted to me. I’m not sure whether to be afraid of him or not. I step back from the window, stand naked at the end of the bed and fall backwards. Somehow he sees me do this through the window. I stay in my room lying on my back, scanning my body for any harmful effects from the spray. I want my husband to come home soon. He does, but only briefly. He has to go somewhere. I offer to drive him because I don’t want to be left alone in case something bad happens to me.",Dreamer 1,Ana,pandemic,2/8/2020

No masks even though covid restrictions are still happening. Here people choose to just enjoy themselves and the company of others. There is a sexual nature to some of these interactions. A man is being carried to an exercise mat and is being rubbed, rolled on and kissed.

Before it was a lot more spacious with only two big beds in each of the rooms. Now there are five smaller beds in one room and women are getting settled in their beds. I go in with my son and we say hello. He climbs up on the different beds. I recognize one person as a patient of mine in waking life. We go into a room we’ve stayed in before. Instead of two beds, this room now has four. I look for mine. I see my friend Dee. People are talking about the pluses and minuses of this new situation. It’s less expensive at least. We go downstairs to a packing and shipping operation. We are being forced into this labor. It’s a Facebook meets Amazon thing. The man is showing us what we need to do. A crane is lifting a huge heavy box filled with rubber masks. It brings it to a truck to be shipped. Now we are all made to sit at our stations and are then given a box of cardboard envelopes. We are supposed to open the box and remove the ten envelopes. I open an envelope, stuff it with a rubber mask and a flyer with the image of an American flag, then lick the flap, seal it closed and put it in another box. We are all doing this. I’m nearly done with my box when I get to an envelope that is deformed. The flap is difficult to open - it’s wrinkled and torn. Once I put the mask in the envelope, I have a really hard time closing it and sealing it. I’m concerned that they’ll come by and look at my work and my work will be unacceptable. I have a sense of my grandmother’s presence for a bit, but then she moves on. They do come by and give me this look and make a note on their clipboard, so now I’m being watched more carefully. Then we are ushered over to a grassy hill, like an outdoor amphitheater. I see Dee again. I also see John Friend (the founder of a yoga system I used to practice) sitting on the grass with a couple young women on either side. The women have these sour judgmental looks on their faces. I find it curious that he’s here in the audience. This is a teaching conference and it seems he’s there to cause disruption and discontent and questioning of the new authority. Somehow because of his presence and the women on his sides, there is less order. The teaching does not come through or land because people are not paying attention to the teaching, but looking at him, wondering why he’s there and what he’s going to do.",Dreamer 1,Ana,environment,30/8/2020

It feels like a hotel in that there is a large foyer with a front desk and a person who assigns rooms and provides plastic card keys. It feels like an apartment in that people are more permanently ehre and the rooms have a kitchen, sitting room and are decorated according to people’s unique tastes. At first I am in my own room. Then I go to a gathering in another room. I’m meeting with a group of people - some who were in my Gaelic language class - and others also from the town where I live. There’s consternation about the growth of the town. When the meeting is over, people go their separate ways. I’m supposed to teach a private yoga lesson. My client has purchased this for her fiance. I’m trying to find him. There’s an older lady from the meeting who delays me. She carries magic, crone wisdom, and seeing skills. She wants to ask me questions and get a read of me. I want to have this connection with her, yet at the same time I need to keep my appointment - a zoom call. It’s getting really close to the start time of the class. She brings me into the kitchen and asks me questions. I’m uncomfortable with the conversation and hoping I’m giving satisfactory answers. I feel out of place. I am now late for my appointment. I’m trying to be present with her and maintain my obligations and somehow let him know I’m running late because I know he’s waiting. Finally, it’s fifteen minutes past the hour and she nods to release me. I’m trying to get to my room so I can start the lesson. When I get to my room, there are other movement instructors in my room and signing in their classes on my computer. They’ve created excel spreadsheets and downloaded new programs on my computer desktop. I’m trying to close those down but not disturb their process. I’m also annoyed they’ve taken over my computer for their own purposes. I’m also uneasy that so many people are passing through my rooms to get to the studio. After all this messing around, I finally sign in. He’s not there. I see that he has checked in eight different times but has given up. I’m disappointed at letting him down. Time passes. I’m looking at a map of a river and structures being built along the river. Somehow I see people on bicycles riding up and down. I also see fires being started as well.

Things get really heated up after I leave. I’m in my room packing and I hear glass break in the hallway. It was something sacred that belonged to Fae’s family. There are shards of glass and metal everywhere. I help pick it up. We have to be careful not to cut ourselves. I’m now helping Fae pack the rest of her things.

The COVID social awkwardness is adding to the standing awkwardness that comes with greeting people for the first time. We go inside. There’s a table for us upstairs. We order and eat. I see a very pregnant woman about to go into labor. They hurry her to a hospital. I’m looking at her and horrified by the idea of giving birth with a mask on. I couldn’t even wear earrings when I was giving birth. People disperse in an unremarkable way. Later in the dream, some guys are building a carnival playset with pipes. You climb up the pipes, do some athletic exercises at the top, then go down the slide. They remove some of the stations on the top part so that it’s not quite as challenging and people can go up, stand and look out, then go down the slide. A strong burly guy climbs up. He does pull ups at the top, then slides down. I notice that he is a bit wider than the slide. The contraption isn’t entirely ready, but they let him test it out. I wonder if they should add some rings for swinging.

I am not facing her but can see her as if I’m looking through a rearview mirror. She turns and walks back to me and asks more questions. She wants to know if it’s possible to do a healing for herself. Then she asks if I can do a healing for her team. I say yes because she is a representative of her team. Then she asks if I can do a healing for her husband and his team. I think that if they’re all in the same company and connected, then I could probably do that. Slowly it comes out that she has missed an important deadline for work for applying for a grant. She’s really upset about this missed opportunity. She works with exotic wildlife, particularly exotic cats. I become lucid in the dream and rise up partially out of it. I realize I have just missed by a few hours an opportunity to apply for a business grant for COVID relief.

I thought the boat was going to stop but it keeps on going. My son is in the water and I’m looking to see if he is still floating. I see him on the wake from another boat. So when the boat swings around, I see him and my heart is relieved to see him floating and riding the wave with his head turned to the side. It looks like he’s having a good time. I lean over and pull him up by the life vest back onto the boat. The boat pulls over to a grassy bank. We get out. There are picnic tables and a few families are camping and getting a meal ready. My son just invites himself to join, immediately finding the kids and playing with them. I’m looking around and notice it’s children and elderly people, no one in between. Somehow, I have the birth records of all the people. I’m looking through the papers and see that there’s an 11 year old girl, a 9 year old boy, a 91 year old man and a 90 year old woman.

They are shouldering in front of each other and getting more food than they are allotted or is appropriate for the number of people who are here. The food gets to be more and more of a mess and spreading on the table and falling to the ground. A woman is next to me with three plates. She is justifying her actions saying, “This is for my son and this is for my daughter and this is for my husband.” She keeps putting more and more pieces on her plate while people are hungrily pushing forward against us.

I make it back to the more open room for music and dancing. People are more distanced here and tables are set up around the perimeter. I am uncomfortable because I have to sit at a table that’s already occupied by people who are in the stoned yoga art community. They kind of welcome me but I feel out of place.

There is an empty chair that I’d like to sit on, but they’ve roped it off and set a warming plate on it for omelettes and pancakes. There are guys in chef hats and aprons making omelettes behind plastic shields hanging from the ceiling. The buffet table has a large selection of breakfast and lunch choices that have been partially eaten. People have cut into the quiches and bread puddings, so it’s been open for a while. I wonder if there would be enough time for me to fully enjoy the brunch if I bought it now. Maybe it would because I could hang out all day listening to music and eating. I walk through and see a group of people setting up for a comedy show. It’s a comedy show about pilgrims and indians. They’re making a pancake breakfast and throwing whipped cream at each other’s faces, so it’s like a clown show meets Thanksgiving. It’s uncomfortable because I didn’t think it was still culturally acceptable to do a pilgrims and indians show for Thanksgiving.",Dreamer 1,Ana,pandemic,19/11/2020

146,,25/5/2020,"Something sinister is happening. We’re in this setting that’s like a retreat center or a communal living place. There’s a common dining area and a pool outside. There are mountains around. I go inside the dining area and check things. We all have to be absolutely silent. I go outside again where people are camped out and hidden, waiting for news. I go back inside. There are stuffed animals all around. Two of the stuffed animals have been unstuffed and then filled with flesh colored thick soupy material that is now pouring out and corroding the floor. I pick them up and take them outside to show the people camped by the water to show them what’s happening. I go back inside to pick up blankets. When I look out the window, the water looks like it’s raining with droplet impressions, but there’s no rain falling from the sky. I try to jump over rocks to get to where the others are hiding. I miss the last rock and one of my feet steps in the water. It’s thicker and more viscous than water and I’m afraid it’s toxic. I pull my leg out quickly and keep going. I see only footprints because everyone has left. I’m worried about why they left so quickly and wonder where they are, if they’ve just gone over the bank to hide or have gone much further. For some reason I can’t follow them. I go back inside and get in line, pretending to be compliant. Others are standing silently in line, waiting to order their food. I’m silent, too. I leave the line and go back outside. People are waiting in the dark for a New Year’s Eve experience. It will be digitized and they’ll be able to watch it by their minds being projected upon. I see a young man who is half Asian, half white, or some kind of mix. We had arranged to escape together. But now, he is enamored by the projection that has been promised to him. It’s like a video game life. I’m trying to bring him away from it with my touch and physical presence. I’m trying to bring him out of the trap but I’m not sure I can because he’s sitting between others who are already entranced. He’s feeling the lure and ease of sitting and having this pleasurable experience versus the embodied experience which is more renegade and possibly painful with exhaustion, hunger, cold and injury.",Dreamer 1,Ana,election,1/1/2021
147,,26/5/2020,"I’m in underground baths of cement or rock. There are different rooms with baths carved into the rock face as well as sinks. There’s a long hallway with rooms off to the right. I go all the way down to the last room. There are no doors. I walk in and go to the sink. I look down to my left and see a big communal bath that has been drained of water. There are brightly colored square pillows arranged in a circle in preparation for a sound bath or meditation of some kind. Two people, a young man and woman, are sitting in the center with their backs to each other and their arms hooked. They look like the typical kind of people you’d see at Esalen before it became more popularized and fancy. They are startled when they see me and yelp and move away from each other as if being close to each other is not allowed and they don’t want to be seen breaking the social rules. I don’t care about the rules though. I go back out and see one of my patients walking down the hall with her child. She doesn’t have a child in waking life, but this girl is a toddler. There’s a black leather wallet on the ground being pushed to the side. It’s open and I can see folded bills and credit cards. I feel like I need to explain myself to my patient and let her know we didn’t quarantine because we were isolated while we were away. Then my son comes running down the hall. He’s wild and out of control like he’s been in waking life. It’s so hard to know what to do with him. Later in the dream I’m hiding out in the car, getting a moment to myself. My husband is dropping our son off at a communal outside area with green grass, dome huts and underground rooms, like a hobbit village. While I’m hiding out in the car, a family I know comes by and they knock on the window. They have two daughters, one the same age as my son and the other just over one. They say hi and ask if I’m coming. I shake my head and say no.",Dreamer 1,Ana,pandemic,2/1/2021
148,,27/5/2020,"I’m driving across the Golden Gate Bridge. It’s been remodeled and this road is higher than the older road. People go really fast across, one car at a time. There are plastic bumpers on the road. It kind of also reminds me of the Pensacola Beach bridge. It’s a bit dangerous because of the speed and height, and there are only minimal guy wires on either side with a lot of strong wind. We barely stay on the road. We are trying to escape something. In another earlier time in the dream, I’m in a cozy house. I’m giving a healing session to a contemporary dancer. Her body is very slight but strong. As I begin working on her, she’s lying next to the fireplace on a folded blanket. Her body moves a lot and she leaps off onto a yoga mat. Then at one point her physical body is kneeling next to mine and we are both working together on her energetic body. The yoga mat leaps away as if her energy body is full of electricity and vitality. We look at each other and laugh with joy at the power of life. As we finish up, she asks for the time. It’s 9pm and it’s time for her to go to rehearsal. She gets up and leaves quickly. I follow her out because I need to go somewhere. She goes into the house next door. I’m surprised because I thought it was empty - the family living there just recently moved to a bigger, nicer house. Maybe she’s renting it while it’s waiting to sell. The house next door to that one is owned by a family with a few kids. They’re getting into their van. I see my son running past their house on the sidewalk and to the corner intersection. I’m running after him so he doesn’t run into the road. Everyone in the family has a long carrot tied to their noses and they look like Pinnochio noses. I think it’s odd, but just yell hello to them as I run after my son who is wild and excited. Then in an earlier part of the dream, I’m on a college campus. Liam is part of this mission. We’re tracking a woman who disappeared a long time ago. We’ve tracked her down into a basement. We go down and people haven’t been here for a long time, but there are a lot of cats roaming around. I see a movement in the corner and it’s her. She’s a young woman with brown skin and she’s only wearing a bikini bottom. She’s forgotten how to be human. She’s moving and making sounds like a cat. In order to get close to her, I remove my clothes, all except my bra top and I move around like a cat, too. I’m speaking to her, cat to cat. She begins to come out but then gets frightened and returns to the shadows. This happens for a while. I’m conscious of Liam watching me move. I have to move quickly and sensuously to appear like a cat and to avoid all the fallen dusty and broken objects that have been here for ages. We finally catch her and bring her upstairs to the light and human world. Now I need to meet up with friends. I’m on a motorcycle and driving down a dirt trail. Then I realize I’m lost and it’s getting dark. I can hardly see the path and I’m getting worried. The motorcycle turns into a bicycle. I’m trying to ride on these dirt paths and am frightened because I’m lost and it’s dark and I’m far out in the woods. Somehow I turn around and find my way back. I leave the bike at the base of some stairs and walk into the lobby of a large building. Friends from my current hometown are all gathered and seem to be waiting for me. Everyone inside has a mask and they are looking at me with scorn because I’m breaking the rules. I try to pull my scarf up over my face and I see other people pulling their shirts over their faces so they can quickly pass through the building and get to the other side. I join my friends and we circle up to prepare for our trip. We’re looking forward to being away from here and able to gather without our masks on.",Dreamer 1,Ana,pandemic,13/1/2021
149,,28/5/2020,"I’m in a big theater, like where they host the Grammys. Every seat is occupied. I’m sitting near the front at the far left with a small group of people, including JP Spears the comedian with a YouTube channel who has swung pretty disturbingly really far left, borderline Q. I don't’ recognize anyone else in my group from waking life. He’s put together a routine for us to perform with him. I’m his assistant. He is telling me about the routine where he’ll make someone float and make them appear to be him. The person he points out is a young girl with long red hair like him. She is unconscious or asleep. We go up the stairs to the stage and he places her on a table. He tosses a blue blanket over her naked body. I’m concerned for her modesty and adjust the blanket as he begins the show. He begins the act and somehow he raises her from the table so she’s floating in the air. This is supposed to be the peak of the performance. There was another part where he made other images of himself, one where he is an older version of himself with a bulbous nose and greying hair. At the end of the routine there isn’t a lot of applause and we all return to our seats. Other presentations continue on the stage. JP Spears is now lying across the top of the seats in front of me. There is a guy sitting to my right who was somewhat attractive. It looks and sounds like they are masturbating each other. They are breathing heavily. It’s disturbing and disgusting. I lean in a bit to see if they’re actually doing what I think they’re doing. JP Spears cums in my face and I’m utterly disgusted now. It gets in my eye and mouth. I get up and leave right away. I’m deciding what to do and where to go now. I don’t know who to report them to, or if I should. I’m outside the theatre. It’s dark and raining. I’m trying to find a car to get back home. I don’t have a home here in this place. So I’m trying to figure out where to go. Later in the dream I am in a house that I’m sharing with my sister and a woman from my current hometown - she and I do the same kind of work, and we’re sharing a room. My sister has her own room. I can’t fall asleep so I get up and wander around the house. The house is a mess with partially unpacked boxes and piles of clothes everywhere. I feel bad about this chaos and how sloppy I am. I just don’t have the energy to put the house in order and it’s also nighttime. She is awake reading, but I don’t think it’s a good idea to make a bunch of noise trying to clean up. I walk past the kitchen and my parents walk in through the door. They are returning early from a trip to the Big Island. They had plans to go on island tours and enjoy the island. They were at dinner and a Senator approached them and told them it was pleasant to see them, but with COVID still actively spreading, they should go home. This is not the time for vacationing. They tell me they were able to catch an early flight. My mom has brought my sister and me some new clothes and jewelry. She has laid out an outfit on the ground - a Christmas sweater that lights up and belonged to my grandmother, jeggings and a gold necklace. My dad has set out guacamole and tortillas for a midnight snack. I eat it and feel better. I get a call from Edward to prepare for a Zoom meeting with a woman who has been working with us. He wants me to find the contract so he can graciously thank her for her help, knowing exactly when she started working with us. I am looking through emails to find the contract but am not sure if that was the exact start date. The first email introduction was sent on October 24. We get on Zoom and she’s calling in from a kids pool. She’s on a playdate with her grandchildren and some others.

At the end of the quarantine we didn’t know what to do. I said I wanted to be married to my husband still and my friend said she wants to be dating him.

When they recognized her, they knew they could switch and get to know the other community. She said yes, knowing they needed a break - knowing more in an omniscient way. It starts with me in a women’s camp environment - it was a futuristic settlement. Everyone wore farmhouse settler dresses and also face masks. This is a landscape I’ve been dreaming of all month but haven’t remembered any details until this episode. I discovered my twin doppelgänger and they had dominion over a galactic camp nearby. They looked like me - their appearance was female but they wore a burdensome huge mask covering head, face and shoulders with interlocking hydraulics spiked around the base. They’re in prairie dresses, but wearing steampunk style masks. You can’t tell who they are because they’re dressed the same and covering their faces. People aren’t addressing each other by name and interacting all day, but not in a personal way. They discovered me from a televised program I was on about agricultural excursions into the reaches of the community borders and asked to do an identity swap. I agreed but was scared. There was a salon area of town with “bars” like downtown but they were only big enough for 2 people each - like a redlight district. These are social distancing bars with screens at each bar, so you can join other people in conversation. It’s psychedelic with bright lights, but it’s dumpy, everything is falling apart. It reminds me of Blade Runner. Mischievous activity is afoot. There were men there. I was doing some restoration work on a building and my two nieces were underfoot chasing each other while I worked. I was stuccoing a building but in a beautiful artistic way with different plant dyed materials and kind of a dancing live art piece. There was a beautiful man dancing and I really wanted him.

We lived in a small apartment above a bakery building. I was the town crazy person. When my child was about seven I totally lost it and was taken away. I think the jail or something like that or a nut house. I knew I was about to be taken and I can still see the look on my son's face when I told him I would never see him again and I was so sorry to leave him alone in a town where he really didn’t belong.

I wasn’t down but everyone was immediately down and then at the end of the evening she pulled me and Bea aside and started talking about her funeral. We didn’t know her so we asked, “Oh are you like terminally ill?” and she’s like, “No, but I plan to die tonight.” Again I’m shook, but Bea seemed fine. She proceeded to tell us that she wanted us to sacrifice her to absolve humanity of its burdens and sins, like she was the second coming of Christ - she didn’t say that but that was the vibe. I didn’t want to do it but everyone else seemed totally down to do it. I also didn’t believe her that she wanted to do that. I kind of thought that maybe she was suicidal but because she was so religious she couldn’t kill herself so she needed somebody else to do it, so she was using the situation to her advantage to get into heaven.

I was home, and then my Aunt Grace from my dad’s side of the family was there and demanding to use the phone to argue with the customer service people for “antiviral” toothpaste. I took the iPad and was annoyed with all of the people so I went to the den, and couldn’t figure it out. I called my nieces who we called “the reds” to try to get their help calling.

I knew I had been there in dreams but not in real life. It was attached to another house behind the driveway. The house had brown shingles with white icicle lights on it. I think it was winter. I was looking inside a window. There were people and they all knew each other but I didn’t know them. I think it wasn’t their house either- they were sheltering there where they were able to survive. There was an old dog bed that did not match the dog in the picture on the counter. I felt sad. There was a peanut butter jar, and I had a taste and threw away the knife and this made the group tell me (they spoke to me as one, not as individuals): “that was a rookie mistake!” But it was not friendly. It was immediately safe but also dangerous, and I could not stay. I did not fit with them. I went to the back of the house and down to a small restaurant. There was a Jacuzzi with a lock on it. I think the dream before that I was walking the streets and there were police out everywhere.

My cousins were there, actually a lot of my dad’s side of the family was there. My finger was on the ground. There were cigarette butts on the ground. My finger was there from last year and I thought to myself that it was too late to reattach it. The parade came and my friend Emily came out of the window across the street all dressed up in an old school dress, dancing and having fun with two other women. They were having fun and yet on our side we were cramped in this van. The parade was a funeral and a big brass band was playing and the song was my favorite cover for a brass band (in real life) and also my mom’s favorite (she’s passed but she loved Allison Krauss version). The song is “I’ll fly away.” Suddenly I realized we were at a funeral and the second line was coming. I went to go get something from the back - I think it was something to write with - and lost my space at the front where I could see. I wanted to get out but the finger and cigarette butts were on the ground (I do not smoke in real life). It was dark and swampy, not day or night. It was later and I was in New York and there were flashing signs and grey gravel streets and I was with someone, a younger black man who had short braids in his hair, he was medium build and we were looking for someone at a scene. We were in the ruins of something and I thought we were uptown or in BK but then I realized we were closer to 90th street. I used to live on 89th in real life.

I said, “It’s really ruined the lives of people who died, and she said, “Name them, name your patients!” I tried to explain that I couldn’t for HIPAA and that I worked in mental health and that many people are impacted right now in many ways, but she was so angry, foaming at the mouth and said, “I don’t want you to have a plate anymore you can leave!”",Dreamer 10,Vera,pandemic,29/5/2020

This woman had to be the driver and it was like these go-karts on a roller coaster almost and we went straight at first and then we made a turn and she was like “oh shit” and we had to go completely vertical and we did.

This dream was both flashing back to the work on something that looked like present day and then flashing to a memory reel, some of it like old pictures. The current flash was this embodied sense of hard work - we were working with a group of people on these box cars to outfit them for something; there was conflict and confusion amongst us but out in the world there was war. We had to work stealth and fast, always at night and these boxcars had to be undetected. The flash to the scenes with the daughter haunt me. I can almost hear her voice and she’s talking about going to New York City and riding around in the backs of trucks and the image is the mother and daughter in a black and white picture in the back of an old truck holding onto a mattress and the narrator is talking about letting her daughter decide where to go and zooming in on the daughter’s face smiling but it’s sad and creepy feeling like something bad happened to the daughter and it just made me want to turn my light on as I write this.

Something happened during the meal where he just stopped talking and he was telling me how much he loved me and he was wearing a red shirt.

Then I was in an apartment with a woman who reminded me of a famous actress and people from work - we were going to make a meal for everyone and it was a big deal. We wore name tags and I had a bandaid on my finger that kept slipping off. The woman was annoyed with me...she was very polished. When we were all settled I pulled four Oracle tree cards for the table and then went around the table to have people pull their cards based on the four I pulled, and read them. I got to the first person and then the second person was the security guard at my unit, this huge guy named Arshis. He’s been in my dreams before. He pulled a card I knew what it would be because when I pulled it I knew it was his, and I said “I knew you would pull that card!” And I started to read it but couldn’t pronounce some of it. It was in Polynesian and then I said “love.” He looked out the window and there was smoke billowing out of the windows of the building to the right of us, like a c-shaped building, and we all went back to our rooms to change and grab our bags to evacuate.

The top was a big meeting type area and if you hiked down about halfway there was a pool and hot tub in the woods with cool lights, and then another mile down was the ocean. Imagine like a tropical Esalen with a mile between cliffs and beach where you could reach the beach safely and warm enough to swim all the time. The first part of my dream I was exploring this landscape alone and barely came across other people. The second time the dining area had reopened and I was in line for dessert and there was cheesecake, but everything looked fake, like not real food. The next time I was there for a weekend with a group of people, all younger than me. We went all the way down to the ocean water and it was pitch black but we lit it up somehow by swirling around in the water, and people were standing and sitting on the edge watching us. It was provocative but not blatantly sexual; it felt more like we were sharing love than having sex but to outsiders, someone commented when we were walking back up “thanks for the show, I’ve been here 60 years and never seen one like that.” I felt embarrassed at the time, like they thought we were disinhibited on drugs or drunk but we weren’t. Then we started walking to the top and it wasn’t nighttime anymore but no sun; it was all gray. There were people who looked homeless (holding small signs) seated wedged in with people enjoying the view. There was an ex boyfriend of mine from high school and I went to say hi. He made a comment about me being seen down below and something about white girls (he is black If this is something meaningful) and seemed angry with me. This was not the response I would expect after 20 plus years of not seeing each other. Then there were more people out and I started walking towards the entrance when three people with huge banners came tumbling down into the crowd and someone yelled “get them out of there! Here we go again!” and it was the people carrying the small sign who were kicking out the big banner people. At the same time a police van pulled in with a man wearing gold spray on pants (you could see where they were coming off) and he was saying “just call my PO,” with a bit of a twangy accent. I looked up at the sky and it was grey/green muted and I felt like I was watching a movie. When I looked down I was back in my apartment but with that same group - one other woman and two men and we were trying to decide what to do. I don’t think I know them in real life but they were familiar.

I looked up and didn’t see cameras in the room (many of the work areas have cameras) so I started taking my clothes off, but before I could change someone came in and was like, “they can see you!” So I ran out naked. I saw one of the security people behind a booth and he also had his shirt off. I went to go see what was going on. He said it was all clear. I went back to the room and two of my colleagues came in laughing and talking about hair dye. I went for a walk and suddenly was below deck. I went to try to get up but there was only a ladder and I was wearing a backpack and felt unsteady when I got to the top rung, so I got down and when I did there was a man trying to escape/elope! He was wearing a green and white neon shirt and holding a bag. He saw me and tried to run and other people were chasing him, too. Then I went back up on an elevator and it was huge. I saw the security guard Arshis as he was leaving for the day and I said, “I’ll walk out with you.” I walked to the train station off of the dock of the boat. I got on the train. We sat down and both of our shirts were off. I just put my head on his shoulder and sank into him. It felt safe. It wasn’t sexual, it wasn’t even really romantic.

I have to do something that people can focus on and take into account all the different functional levels etc. (my clinical reasoning) and I didn’t end up saying that to them. I started designing a group that would meet all the functional needs including this person‘s preferences. It was like going inside the mind of an occupational therapist.

I walked by shrugging my shoulders like “yup, that happens!” It was very nonchalant. Pinto (my dog) and I are in a different apartment and I don’t think I am me now. It was vintage modern design and had a lot of dog toys including a play castle that took up a lot of space. He wasn’t able to play on it much but it was his favorite (no idea in real life). There were workers not wearing masks in the hallway and I yelled at them. They were putting a clear outer door over all the unit doors. It was a hallway that looked familiar but not mine (like the apartment). Pinto and I went to go see dog friends, Chuck and Trevor, and somehow Chuck was a small dog maybe a wiener mix. I knew that I used to have them together or that they belonged together. Then he morphed into a golden red Chuck similar to now but younger. Trevor was there and the same as he is in real life. We were on wooden outdoor stairs over water, maybe at a wharf, and the leashes kept getting tangled but I couldn’t see the other owner. I assumed it was my ex Rory, but it was like we didn’t know him.",Dreamer 10,Vera,pandemic,20/12/2020

I got livid mad and cursed her out. She was going to book the next appointment and I told her, “No fucking way.” (In real life I have an amazing therapist so no idea what this is about). Then I left and I was naked in a wheelchair going down the halls and knew I needed clothes so I got gray sweatpants from the closet (the same hospital kind we offer our homeless patients). Then I think I went into a new dream. I was looking for my dog Pinto and was walking through what looked like a school but it was a physical therapy office or rec center. I saw some of my inpatient psych patients (in my dream I recognized them as clear as day as former patients but now that I’m thinking about them I can’t recall their faces). They were all older women. They were walking down a hallway with a PT taking turns getting treatment. One was on oxygen. They looked at me and I looked at them but didn’t say anything for their privacy. I went through double doors and there was an indoor pool and Pinto was there at the end of it with some people and maybe my sister Sarah. I said I was worried about him hanging around there this year because he is not doing well and I don’t want him to fall or step in the pool and drown. They told me they wouldn’t let it happen. But I wouldn’t leave. Then I woke up because Pinto woke up.",Dreamer 10,Vera,pandemic,20/12/2020

Then fast forward, I was at the same location and we were doing a world service. I sat in the front room with one of the attendings, Dr. Donovan.

I was nervous about it and I wasn’t wearing a mask, but I was covering my face with a white tissue. We were all driving somewhere and then we pulled over to this big dusty parking lot. We were going to get in the shuttles and I got really nervous about going in the shuttle. This big group of kids on tricycles and other things came charging through the parking lot. They were all black kids on tricycles and some other things. It looked like they knew where they were going. The next thing that happened was everybody came down a tube-like thing, like a slide, and one at a time. My nieces came down. Then my sister had a guy there and I didn’t like him. I knew that it wasn’t my ex brother-in-law but he had a similar energy and he was trying to impress the family. I did not like him at all and my sister was nervous about him meeting the family. She took forever to come down on her slide turn. Then we were in this car and I was trying to put these credit card numbers in and take turns with other people I don’t know. We’re in really close quarters trying to get these credit cards to work before we got to the game. Then I was carrying the speaker box and the front of it had lights in a Christmas tree design.

All of a sudden this huge wave came like a tsunami over the lunch table and we all braced ourselves, shouting out to make sure we were okay. After that was gone we started eating again when a larger tsunami wave came and I saw it in slow motion. We all grabbed hands (almost like in a formation like what it looks like when skydivers do a circular formation) and we were like “hold on!!!!!!” We went under the water and tumbled around.

It wasn’t at my hospital but it was like a similar situation to mine. It looked like a smaller local hospital somewhere. I got a day off and I went to check out this local restaurant (in real life I haven't gone to any restaurants, just take out and delivery). In the dream it almost looked like I was in a different state entirely. It was heavily wooded and more rural. I drove up to this huge house looking thing that happened to be a restaurant and there was a line of people outside. These two men were out there and they seemed nice. It seems like they are brothers, they're both wearing red plaid shirts like flannel and they invited us in for a tour, It was like we were there for something other than just to get food, like it was some kind of extra offering. We went inside. They showed us the billiards room and sat down and were talking, The guy who was leading it made an offhand racist comment. I can’t remember what it was but I didn’t say anything the first time and then the second time he said something and I was in a room and I realized everybody else was white. I put my hand up and I called him out on it and then he started questioning me and qualifying me and then he used the N-word. I got mad and left and he was snorting at me and making a big deal out of it. I think for some reason in my mind we were friends on Facebook and I went to go unfriend him and his name was Dave Ohlone. As I’m writing this I realize that I am on native Ohlone land!
